Moreover, we modify the T operator in the the Lax pair of the CKdV equation, in the search of a (2+1)-dimensional case and thereby propose a new equation in (2+1) dimensions. We named this the (2+1)-dimensional CKdV equation. We show that the CKdV equation as well as the (2+1)-dimensional CKdV equation are integrable in the sense that they possess the Painlev\'e property.

  surfaces","Transformations between different analytic descriptions of constant mean curvature (CMC) surfaces are established. In particular, it is demonstrated that the system \[ \begin{split} &\partial \psi_{1} = (|\psi_{1}|^{2} + |\psi_{2}|^{2}) \psi_{2} \\ &\bar{\partial} \psi_{2} =- (|\psi_{1}|^{2} + |\psi_{2}|^{2}) \psi_{1} \end{split} \] descriptive of CMC surfaces within the framework of the generalized Weierstrass representation, decouples into a direct sum of the elliptic Sh-Gordon and Laplace equations. Connections of this system with the sigma model equations are established. It is pointed out, that the instanton solutions correspond to different Weierstrass parametrizations of the standard sphere $S^{2} \subset E^{3}$.",Eugene V. Ferapontov; Alfred M.

nlin/0001071v1,On the calculation of finite-gap solutions of the KdV equation,"A simple and general approach for calculating the elliptic finite-gap solutions of the Korteweg-de Vries (KdV) equation is proposed. Our approach is based on the use of the finite-gap equations and the general representation of these solutions in the form of rational functions of the elliptic Weierstrass function. The calculation of initial elliptic finite-gap solutions is reduced to the solution of the finite-band equations with respect to the parameters of the representation. The time evolution of these solutions is described via the dynamic equations of their poles, integrated with the help of the finite-gap equations. The proposed approach is applied by calculating the elliptic 1-, 2- and 3-gap solutions of the KdV equations.",Andrii Korostil,nlin.SI,nlin.SI

Iterations of the B\""acklund transformations can be described in the terms of nonrelativistic lattices of the Toda type. Several multifield generalizations are presented.",Vsevolod E.

Our construction of the amplitude does not rely directly on Feynman diagrams, but instead uses its analytic properties in 4 - 2 epsilon dimensions. We evaluate the loop integrals appearing in the amplitude through O(epsilon^0) in terms of polylogarithms.",Z. Bern; L. Dixon; D. A. Kosower,hep-ph,hep-ph; hep-th
cond-mat/0001001v1,"Statistical thermodynamics of membrane bending mediated protein-protein
  attraction","Integral membrane proteins deform the surrounding bilayer creating long-ranged forces that influence distant proteins. These forces can be attractive or repulsive, depending on the proteins' shape, height, contact angle with the bilayer, as well as the local membrane curvature. Although interaction energies are not pairwise additive, for sufficiently low protein density, thermodynamic properties depend only upon pair interactions. Here, we compute pair interaction potentials and entropic contributions to the two-dimensional osmotic pressure of a collection of noncircular proteins. In contrast to direct short-ranged interactions such as van der Waal's, hydrophobic, or electrostatic interactions, both local membrane Gaussian curvature and protein ellipticity can induce attractions between two proteins at distances of up to ten times their typical radii. For flat membranes, bending rigidities of $\sim 30k_{B}T$, and moderate ellipticities, we find thermally averaged attractive interactions of order $\sim 2k_{B}T$. These interactions may play an important role in the intermediate stages of protein aggregation.",Tom Chou; Ken S. Kim; George Oster,cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.stat-mech; cond-mat.soft; q-bio.BM
cond-mat/0001002v3,Strong Coupling Approach to the Supersymmetric Kondo Model,"We carry out the strong coupling expansion for the SU(N) Kondo model where the impurity spin is represented by a L-shaped Young tableau. Using second order perturbation theory around the strong coupling fixed point it is shown that when the antisymmetric component of the Young-tableau contains more than N/2 entries, the strong-coupling fixed point becomes unstable to a two-stage Kondo effect. By comparing the strong coupling results obtained here with the result using a supersymmetric large N expansion, we are also able to confirm the validity of the the supersymmetric formalism for mixed symmetry Kondo models.",P.

hep-th/0001001v2,"Compactification, Geometry and Duality: N=2",These are notes based on lectures given at TASI99. We review the geometry of the moduli space of N=2 theories in four dimensions from the point of view of superstring compactification. The cases of a type IIA or type IIB string compactified on a Calabi-Yau threefold and the heterotic string compactified on K3xT2 are each considered in detail. We pay specific attention to the differences between N=2 theories and N>2 theories. The moduli spaces of vector multiplets and the moduli spaces of hypermultiplets are reviewed. In the case of hypermultiplets this review is limited by the poor state of our current understanding. Some peculiarities such as ``mixed instantons'' and the non-existence of a universal hypermultiplet are discussed.,Paul S. Aspinwall,hep-th,hep-th

physics/0001001v1,Capillary-gravity wave transport over spatially random drift,"We derive transport equations for the propagation of water wave action in the presence of a static, spatially random surface drift. Using the Wigner distribution $\W(\x,\k,t)$ to represent the envelope of the wave amplitude at position $\x$ contained in waves with wavevector $\k$, we describe surface wave transport over static flows consisting of two length scales; one varying smoothly on the wavelength scale, the other varying on a scale comparable to the wavelength. The spatially rapidly varying but weak surface flows augment the characteristic equations with scattering terms that are explicit functions of the correlations of the random surface currents. These scattering terms depend parametrically on the magnitudes and directions of the smoothly varying drift and are shown to give rise to a Doppler coupled scattering mechanism. The Doppler interaction in the presence of slowly varying drift modifies the scattering processes and provides a mechanism for coupling long wavelengths with short wavelengths. Conservation of wave action (CWA), typically derived for slowly varying drift, is extended to systems with rapidly varying flow. At yet larger propagation distances, we derive from the transport equations, an equation for wave energy diffusion. The associated diffusion constant is also expressed in terms of the surface flow correlations. Our results provide a formal set of equations to analyse transport of surface wave action, intensity, energy, and wave scattering as a function of the slowly varying drifts and the correlation functions of the random, highly oscillatory surface flows.",Guillaume Bal; Tom Chou,physics.flu-dyn,physics.flu-dyn; physics.ao-ph
hep-ex/0001002v1,Search for the Decay B0 -> D*0 gamma,"We report results of a search for the rare radiative decay B0 -> D*0 gamma. Using 9.7 million BB meson pairs collected with the CLEO detector at the Cornell Electron Storage Ring, we limit Br(B0->D*0 gamma) < 5.0 * 10^-5 at 90% CL. This provides evidence that anomalous enhancement is absent in W-exchange processes and that weak radiative B decays are dominated by the short-distance b -> s gamma mechanism in the Standard Model.",CLEO Collaboration,hep-ex,hep-ex; hep-ph
cond-mat/0001003v2,Luttinger Liquid Physics in the Superconductor Vortex Core,"We study several aspects of the structure of vortices in conventional s-wave Type $II$ superconductors. It is well-known that there are low energy quasiparticles bound to the core of a vortex. We show that under certain conditions, these quasiparticles form a degenerate Fermi gas with a finite density of states at the Fermi energy. In three dimensional superconductors, the result is a one dimensional Fermi gas of quasiparticles bound to the core of a vortex line. As is usual in one dimensional systems, interactions between the quasiparticles lead to Luttinger liquid behaviour. This may be probed through STM tunneling into the vortex core. We further suggest that a novel Peierls-type instability in the shape of the vortex line may develop due to interactions between the quasiparticle gas and fluctuations in the vortex line shape.",Ashvin Vishwanath; T.

astro-ph/0001001v1,Statistics of Turbulence from Spectral-Line Data Cubes,"Emission in spectral lines can provide unique information on interstellar turbulence. Doppler shifts due to supersonic motions contain information on turbulent velocity field which is otherwise difficult to measure. However, the problem of separation of velocity and density fluctuations is far from being trivial. Using atomic hydrogen (HI) as a test case, I review techniques applicable to emission line studies with the emphasis on those that can provide information on the underlying power spectra of velocity and density. I show that recently developed mathematical machinery is promising for the purpose. Its application to HI shows that in cold neutral hydrogen the velocity fluctuations dominate the small scale structures observed in spectral-line data cubes and this result is very important for the interpretation of observational data, including the identification of clouds. Velocity fluctuations are shown to dominate the formation of small scale structures that can be erroneously identified as diffuse clouds. One may argue that the HI data is consistent with the Goldreich-Shridhar picture of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence, but the cascade from the scales of several kpc that this interpretation involves does not fit well in the current paradigm of energy injection. The issue whether magnetic field does make the turbulence anisotropic is still open, but if this is the case, I show that studies of emission lines can provide a reliable way of determining magnetic field direction. I discuss various techniques for studying interstellar turbulence using emission lines, e.g. spectral correlation functions, genus statistics and principal component analysis.",A.

gr-qc/0001001v1,"Can Quantum Cosmology Give Observational Consequences of Many-Worlds
  Quantum Theory?","Although many people have thought that the difference between the Copenhagen and many-worlds versions of quantum theory was merely metaphysical, quantum cosmology may allow us to make a physical test to distinguish between them empirically. The difference between the two versions shows up when the various components of the wavefunction have different numbers of observers and observations. In the Copenhagen version, a random observation is selected from the sample within the component that is selected by wavefunction collapse, but in the many-worlds version, a random observation is selected from those in all components. Because of the difference in the samples, probable observations in one version can be very improbable in the other version.",Don N. Page,gr-qc,gr-qc

We examine thermodynamical properties of texture matter in comparison with radiation fluid and bubble matter. Then we study dynamics of thin-wall selfgravitating texture objects, and show that classical motion can be elliptical (finite), parabolical or hyperbolical. It is shown that total gravitational mass of neutral textures in equilibrium equals to zero as was expected. Finally, we perform the Wheeler-DeWitt's minisuperspace quantization of the theory, obtain exact wave functions and discrete spectra of bound states with provision for spatial topology.",Konstantin G.

The elementary excitations are calculated through an efficient quantum Monte Carlo technique featuring imaginary-time correlation functions and are characterized in terms of interacting spin waves. The thermal behavior is analyzed with particular emphasis on its ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic dual aspect. The extensive numerical and analytic calculations lead to the classification of the one-dimensional ferrimagnetic behavior according to the constituent spins: the ferromagnetic ($S>2s$), antiferromagnetic ($S<2s$), and balanced ($S=2s$) ferrimagnetism.",Shoji Yamamoto; Takahiro Fukui; Toru Sakai,cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.stat-mech; cond-mat.str-el
hep-th/0001003v1,"Comment on ""Metric Fluctuations in Brane Worlds""","Recently, Ivanov and Volovich (hep-th/9912242) claimed that the perturbation of $h_{\mu\nu}$ with nonvanishing transverse components $h_{5\mu}$ is not localized on the brane because $h_{\mu\nu}$ depends on the fifth coordinate $z$ linearly. Consequently, it may indicate that the effective theory is unstable. However, we point out that such linear dependence on $z$ can be {\it gauged away}. Hence the solution does not belong to the physical one. Therefore, even if one includes $h_{5\mu}$, Randall and Sundrum's argument for the localized gravity on the brane remains correct.",Y. S.

hep-ph/0001002v3,"Reconciling the Two-Loop Diagrammatic and Effective Field Theory
  Computations of the Mass of the Lightest CP-even Higgs Boson in the MSSM","The mass of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model (MSSM) has previously been computed including O(alpha alpha_s) two-loop contributions by an on-shell diagrammatic method, while approximate analytic results have also been obtained via renormalization-group-improved effective potential and effective field theory techniques. Initial comparisons of the corresponding two-loop results revealed an apparent discrepancy between terms that depend logarithmically on the supersymmetry-breaking scale, and different dependences of the non-logarithmic terms on the squark mixing parameter, X_t. In this paper, we determine the origin of these differences as a consequence of different renormalization schemes in which both calculations are performed. By re-expressing the on-shell result in terms of MS-bar parameters, the logarithmic two-loop contributions obtained by the different approaches are shown to coincide. The remaining difference, arising from genuine non-logarithmic two-loop contributions, is identified, and its effect on the maximal value of the lightest CP-even Higgs boson mass is discussed. Finally, we show that in a simple analytic approximation to the Higgs mass, the leading two-loop radiative corrections can be absorbed to a large extent into an effective one-loop expression by evaluating the running top quark mass at appropriately chosen energy scales.",M.

In this paper we establish a similar relationship between the pencils of formal flat connections (or solutions to the Commutativity Equations) and homology of a new series $\bar{L}_n$ of pointed stable curves of genus zero. Whereas $\bar{M}_{0,n+1}$ parametrizes trees of $\bold{P}^1$'s with pairwise distinct nonsingular marked points, $\bar{L}_n$ parametrizes strings of $\bold{P}^1$'s stabilized by marked points of two types. The union of all $\bar{L}_n$'s forms a semigroup rather than operad, and the role of operadic algebras is taken over by the representations of the appropriately twisted homology algebra of this union.",A.

The symplectic quotients considered here are compact symplectic manifolds (or more generally orbifolds), which arise as the symplectic quotients of a symplectic manifold by a compact torus. (A companion paper examines symplectic quotients by a nonabelian group, showing how to reduce to the maximal torus.)   Let X be a symplectic manifold, with a Hamiltonian action of a compact torus T. The main topological result of this paper describes an explicit cobordism that exists between a symplectic quotient of X by T, and a collection of iterated projective bundles over components of the set of T-fixed-points.   The characteristic classes of these bundles can be determined explicitly, and another result uses this to give formulae for integrals of cohomology classes over the symplectic quotient, in terms of data localized at the T-fixed points of X.",Shaun Martin,math.SG,math.SG

The three main results are: a formula expressing the rational cohomology ring of X//G in terms of the rational cohomology ring of X//T; an `integration' formula, which expresses cohomology pairings on X//G in terms of cohomology pairings on X//T; and an index formula, which expresses the indices of elliptic operators on X//G in terms of indices on X//T.   (The results of this paper are complemented by the results in a companion paper, in which different techniques are used to derive formulae for cohomology pairings on symplectic quotients X//T, where T is a torus, in terms of the T-fixed points of X. That paper also gives some applications of the formulae proved here.)",Shaun Martin,math.SG,math.SG
hep-th/0001004v1,Moving Mirrors and Thermodynamic Paradoxes,"Quantum fields responding to ""moving mirrors"" have been predicted to give rise to thermodynamic paradoxes. I show that the assumption in such work that the mirror can be treated as an external field is invalid: the exotic energy-transfer effects necessary to the paradoxes are well below the scales at which the model is credible. For a first-quantized point-particle mirror, it appears that exotic energy-transfers are lost in the quantum uncertainty in the mirror's state. An accurate accounting of these energies will require a model which recognizes the mirror's finite reflectivity, and almost certainly a model which allows for the excitation of internal mirror modes, that is, a second-quantized model.",Adam D.

Taking note of the surprising semiquantitative success of this description for charm hadrons I interprete the new data on $\tau (D_s)$ and re-iterate the call for more precise measurements of $\tau (\Xi_c^{0,+})$ and $\tau (\Omega_c)$. A slightly larger $B^-$ than $B_d$ lifetime is starting to emerge as predicted; the largest lifetime difference in the beauty sector, namely in $\tau (B_c)$ vs. $\tau (B)$ has correctly been predicted; the problem posed by the short $\Lambda_b$ lifetime remains.

As an example, we study the sub-Poissonian statistics and squeezing effects of the photon-added geometric states with negative values of $m$ in detail.

The numerical experiments follow the formation of galaxy-sized halos in two Cold Dark Matter dominated universes: the standard Omega=1 CDM scenario and the currently popular LCDM model. We find that the slope and scatter of the I-band Tully-Fisher relation are well reproduced in the simulations, although not, as proposed in recent work, as a result of the cosmological equivalence between halo mass and circular velocity: large systematic variations in the fraction of baryons that collapse to form galaxies and in the ratio between halo and disk circular velocities are observed in our numerical experiments. The Tully-Fisher slope and scatter are recovered in this model as a direct result of the dynamical response of the halo to the assembly of the luminous component of the galaxy. We conclude that models that neglect the self-gravity of the disk and its influence on the detailed structure of the halo cannot be used to derive meaningful estimates of the scatter or slope of the Tully-Fisher relation. Our models fail, however, to match the zero-point of the Tully-Fisher relation, as well as that of the relation linking disk rotation speed and angular momentum. These failures can be traced, respectively, to the excessive central concentration of dark halos formed in the Cold Dark Matter cosmogonies we explore and to the formation of galaxy disks as the final outcome of a sequence of merger events.

cond-mat/0001005v1,Linear and nonlinear rheology of wormlike micelles,"Several surfactant molecules self-assemble in solution to form long, cylindrical, flexible wormlike micelles. These micelles can be entangled with each other leading to viscoelastic phases. The rheological properties of such phases are very interesting and have been the subject of a large number of experimental and theoretical studies in recent years. We shall report on our recent work on the macrorheology, microrheology and nonlinear flow behaviour of dilute aqueous solutions of a surfactant CTAT (Cetyltrimethylammonium Tosilate). This system forms elongated micelles and exhibits strong viscoelasticity at low concentrations ($\sim$ 0.9 wt%) without the addition of electrolytes. Microrheology measurements of $G(\omega)$ have been done using diffusing wave spectroscopy which will be compared with the conventional frequency sweep measurements done using a cone and plate rheometer. The second part of the paper deals with the nonlinear rheology where the measured shear stress $\sigma$ is a nonmonotonic function of the shear rate $\dot{\gamma}$. In stress-controlled experiments, the shear stress shows a plateau for $\dot{\gamma}$ larger than some critical strain rate, similar to the earlier reports on CPyCl/NaSal system. Cates et al have proposed that the plateau is a signature of mechanical instability in the form of shear bands. We have carried out extensive experiments under controlled strain rate conditions, to study the time-dependence of shear stress. The measured time series of shear stress has been analysed in terms of correlation integrals and Lyapunov exponents to show unambiguously that the behaviour is typical of low dimensional dynamical systems.",A.

astro-ph/0001006v1,On the Clustering of GRBs on the Sky,The two-point correlation of the 4th (current) BATSE catalog (2494 objects) is calculated. It is shown to be consistent with zero at nearly all angular scales of interest. Assuming that GRBs trace the large scale structure in the universe we calculate the angular correlation function for the standard CDM (sCDM) model. It is shown to be $\le 10^{-4}$ at $\theta \simeq 5^\circ$ if the BATSE catalog is assumed to be a volume-limited sample up to $z \simeq 1$. Combined with the error analysis on the BATSE catalog this suggests that nearly $10^5$ GRBs will be needed to make a positive detection of the two-point angular correlation function at this angular scale.,Shiv K.

Our data cover a wider field than any previous CCD photometry as well as going deeper. Surface brightness profiles of NGC 4472 are not well fit by a single King model, but they can be fit approximately by two King models: with separate models for the inner and outer regions. Surface brightness profiles for the outer region can also be fit approximately by a deVaucouleurs law. There is clearly a negative color gradient within 3' of NGC 4472, in the sense that the color gets bluer with increasing radius. The slope of the color gradient for this region is derived to be $\Delta \mu (C-T_1)$ = -0.08 mag arcsec$^{-2}$ for $\Delta \log r =1$, which corresponds to a metallicity gradient of $\Delta$ [Fe/H] $= -0.2$ dex.

In the case of less than one as well as one electron per atom, the on-site Coulomb repulsion is given by U={kappa}{rho}^2U_c by averaging the electron charge per atom over all atomic sites, where {kappa} is the correlation strength of U, {rho} is the band filling factor, and U_c is the critical on-site Coulomb energy. The effective mass of a quasiparticle is found to be m*/m=1/{1-{kappa}^2{rho}^4} for 0<{kappa}{rho}^2<1 and seems to follow the heat capacity data of Sr_{1-x}La_xTiO_3 and YBa_2Cu_3O_{7-delta} at {kappa}=1 and 0<{kappa}{rho}^2<1. The Mott transition of the first order occurs at {kappa}{rho}^2=1 and a band-type metal-insulator transition takes place at {kappa}{rho}^2=0.

With the 0.5--10 keV luminosities in the range 10^{39-40} ergs/s, they are thought to represent a class of enigmatic X-ray sources often found in spiral galaxies. For some of them, the ASCA data are newly processed, or the published spectra are reanalyzed. For others, the published results are quoted. The ASCA spectra of all these seven sources have been described successfully with so called multi-color disk blackbody (MCD) emission arising from optically-thick standard accretion disks around black holes. Except the case of M33 X-8, the spectra do not exhibit hard tails. For the source luminosities not to exceed the Eddington limits, the black holes are inferred to have rather high masses, up to ~100 solar masses. However, the observed innermost disk temperatures of these objects, Tin = 1.1--1.8 keV, are too high to be compatible with the required high black-hole masses, as long as the standard accretion disks around Schwarzschild black holes are assumed. Similarly high disk temperatures are also observed from two Galactic transients with superluminal motions, GRO 1655-40 and GRS 1915+105. The issue of unusually high disk temperature may be explained by the black hole rotation, which makes the disk get closer to the black hole, and hence hotter.",Kazuo Makishima; Aya Kubota; Tsunefumi Mizuno; Tomohisa Ohnishi; Makoto Tashiro; Yoichi Aruga; Kazumi Asai; Tadayasu Dotani; Kazuhisa Mitsuda; Yoshihiro Ueda; Shin'ichiro Uno; Kazutaka Yamaoka; Ken Ebisawa; Yoshiki Kohmura; Kyoko Okada,astro-ph,astro-ph

The Landau-Zener transition is fully suppressed for the values of the bias below a threshold bias set by the coupling strength.

The main body of a symbiotic nebula is thus formed from material lost in the giant wind, while the hot component is responsible for its ionization and excitation. In addition, the fast wind and/or jet ejection from the hot component, whenever occur, give rise to the complex, often bipolar, shape of symbiotic nebulae.

astro-ph/0001013v1,"Formation of Millisecond Pulsars with Heavy White Dwarf Companions -
  Extreme Mass Transfer on Sub-Thermal Timescales","We have performed detailed numerical calculations of the non-conservative evolution of close X-ray binary systems with intermediate-mass (2.0-6.0 M_sun) donor stars and a 1.3 M_sun accreting neutron star. We calculated the thermal response of the donor star to mass loss, in order to determine its stability and follow the evolution of the mass transfer. Under the assumption of the ""isotropic re-emission model"" we demonstrate that in many cases it is possible for the binary to prevent a spiral-in and survive a highly super-Eddington mass-transfer phase (1 << M_dot/M_Edd < 10^5) on a sub-thermal timescale, if the convective envelope of the donor star is not too deep. These systems thus provide a new formation channel for binary millisecond pulsars with heavy CO white dwarfs and relatively short orbital periods (3-50 days). However, we conclude that to produce a binary pulsar with a O-Ne-Mg white dwarf or P_orb ~1 day (e.g. PSR B0655+64) the above scenario does not work, and a spiral-in phase is still considered the most plausible scenario for the formation of such a system.",T.

Binaries which would otherwise suffer from dynamically unstable mass transfer (leading to the formation of a common envelope and spiral-in evolution) are thus shown to survive a phase of extreme mass transfer on a sub-thermal timescale. Furthermore, we discuss the orbital evolution prior to RLO in X-ray binaries with low-mass donors, caused by the competing effects of wind mass loss and tidal effects due to expansion of the (sub)giant.",T.

This generates a mechanism similar to that of Goldberger-Wise for radion stabilization and the recovery of late-cosmology features in the branes. Due to the induced radion dynamics, the inflating branes roll towards the minimum of the radion potential, thereby exiting inflation and reheating the Universe. In the slow roll part of the potential, the 'TeV' branes have maximum inflation rate and energy as their coupling to the radion and bulk modes have minimum suppresion. Hence, when rolling down the steep end of the potential towards the stable point, the radion field (which appears as the inflaton of the effective 4D theory in the branes) decays very fast, reheats the Universe .This process results decayin a decrease of brane's canonical vacuum energy $\Lambda_4$. However, at the minimum of the potential $\Lambda_4$ is small but not neccessarily zero and the fine-tuning issue remains .Density perturbation constraints introduce an upper bound when the radion stabilizies. Due to the large radion mass and strong suppression to the bulk modes, moduli problems and bulk reheating do not occur. The reheat temperature and a sufficient number of e-folding constraints for the brane-universe are also satisfied. The model therefore recovers the radiation dominated FRW universe.",L.

The processes we consider are leading order in gA and are simillar to A -> e^+e^- in QED. Gluons are treated like a matter field and gauge transformations of the quantum gluonic field are different from those of the classical chromofield. To obtain the correct physical polarization of gluons we deduct the corresponding ghost contributions. We find that the expression for the probability of the leading order process A -> gg is transverse with respect to the momentum of the field. We observe that the contributions from higher order processes to gluon pair production need to be added to the this leading order process. Our result presented here is a part of the expression for the total probability for gluon pair production from a space-time dependent chromfield. The result for q \bar{q} pair production is similar to that of the e^+e^- pair production in QED.

We review some of the extant data here, concluding that in a few clusters the AGB stars show on average smaller amounts of high-temperature proton-capture synthesis products (low oxygen, high sodium and aluminum) at their surfaces than do the first-ascent RGB stars. This suggests that those RGB stars with envelopes that have been enriched with proton-capture material also have high helium contents.

  scattering","The emission of electromagnetic waves from a source within or near a non-trivial medium (with or without boundaries, crystalline or amorphous, with inhomogeneities, absorption and so on) is sometimes studied using the reciprocity principle. This is a variation of the method of Green's functions. If one is only interested in the asymptotic radiation fields the generality of these methods may actually be a shortcoming: obtaining expressions valid for the uninteresting near fields is not just a wasted effort but may be prohibitively difficult. In this work we obtain a modified form the reciprocity principle which gives the asymptotic radiation field directly. The method may be used to obtain the radiation from a prescribed source, and also to study scattering problems. To illustrate the power of the method we study a few pedagogical examples and then, as a more challenging application we tackle two related problems. We calculate the specular reflection of x rays by a rough surface and by a smoothly graded surface taking polarization effects into account. In conventional treatments of reflection x rays are treated as scalar waves, polarization effects are neglected. This is a good approximation at grazing incidence but becomes increasingly questionable for soft x rays and UV at higher incidence angles.

  continuum and molecular-line observation","This paper examines the density and velocity structure of envelopes around young stellar objects through submillimeter continuum imaging of four objects in Taurus and previously obtained molecular-line data. Observations carried out with the SCUBA on the JCMT at 850 and 450 micron of L1489 IRS, L1535 IRS, L1527 IRS, and TMC 1 reveal ~2000 AU elongated structures embedded in extended envelopes. The density distribution in these envelopes is equally well fit by a radial power-law of index p=1.0-2.0 or with a collapse model such as that of Shu (1997: ApJ, 214, 488). This inside-out collapse model predicts 13CO, C18O, HCO+, and H13CO+ line profiles which closely match observed spectra toward three of our four sources. This shows that the inside-out collapse model offers a good description of YSO envelopes, but also that reliable constraints on its parameters require independent measurements of the density and the velocity structure, e.g., through continuum and line observations. For the remaining source, L1489 IRS, we find that a model consisting of a 2000 AU radius, rotating, disk-like structure better describes the data. Possibly, this source is in transition between the embedded Class I and the optically revealed T Tauri phases. Two apparently starless cores are found at ~10,000 AU from L1489 IRS and L1535 IRS. They are cold, 10-15 K, contain 0.5-3.0 M_sol, and have flat density distributions characterized by a Gaussian of ~10,000 AU FWHM.

In the present paper, we consider the problem of which systems of congruences can be satisfied using open subsets of the sphere (or related spaces); of course, these open sets cannot form a partition of the sphere, but they can be required to cover ""most of"" the sphere in the sense that their union is dense. Various versions of the problem arise, depending on whether one uses all isometries of the sphere or restricts oneself to a free group of rotations (the latter version generalizes to many other suitable spaces), or whether one omits the requirement that the open sets have dense union, and so on. While some cases of these problems are solved by simple geometrical dissections, others involve complicated iterative constructions and/or results from the theory of free groups.

  J0414+0534","We employ a multipole-Taylor expansion to investigate how tightly the gravitational potential of the quadruple-image lens MG J0414+0534 is constrained by recent VLBI observations. These observations revealed that each of the four images of the background radio source contains four distinct components, thereby providing more numerous and more precise constraints on the lens potential than were previously available. We expand the two-dimensional lens potential using multipoles for the angular coordinate and a modified Taylor series for the radial coordinate. After discussing the physical significance of each term, we compute models of MG J0414+0534 using only VLBI positions as constraints. The best-fit model has both interior and exterior quadrupole moments as well as exterior m=3 and m=4 multipole moments. The deflector centroid in the models matches the optical galaxy position, and the quadrupoles are aligned with the optical isophotes. The radial distribution of mass could not be well constrained. We discuss the implications of these models for the deflector mass distribution and for the predicted time delays between lensed components.",Catherine S. Trotter; Joshua N. Winn; Jacqueline N.

math/0001009v1,Solutions to congruences using sets with the property of Baire,"Hausdorff's paradoxical decomposition of a sphere with countably many points removed (the main precursor of the Banach-Tarski paradox) actually produced a partition of this set into three pieces A,B,C such that A is congruent to B (i.e., there is an isometry of the set which sends A to B), B is congruent to C, and A is congruent to (B union C). While refining the Banach-Tarski paradox, R. Robinson characterized the systems of congruences like this which could be realized by partitions of the sphere with rotations witnessing the congruences. The purpose of the present paper is to characterize those systems of congruences which can be satisfied by partitions of the sphere or related spaces (any complete metric space acted on in a sufficiently free way by a free group of homeomorphisms) into sets with the property of Baire. Dougherty and Foreman proved that the Banach-Tarski paradox can be achieved using such sets, and gave versions of this result using open sets and related results about partitions of spaces into congruent sets. The same methods are used here. We also characterize the systems solvable on the sphere using sets with the property of Baire but allowing all isometries (instead of just rotations).",Randall Dougherty,math.MG,"math.MG; math.LO; 52B45 (Primary), 03E25, 04A25, 54E52 (Secondary)"

The constrained model is based on the minimal supergravity-inspired framework for the MSSM, with universal scalar and gaugino masses $m_0, m_{1/2}$, and $\mu$ and the MSSM Higgs masses treated as dependent parameters.

On the anti-de Sitter (AdS) side, these walls have a repulsive gravity with an asymptotic region corresponding to the Cauchy horizon, while on the other side the runaway dilaton approaches the weak coupling regime and a non-singular attractive gravity, with the asymptotic region corresponding to the boundary of spacetime. We contrast these results with the situation for gauged supergravity potentials for massless scalar modes, whose supersymmetric AdS extrema are generically maxima, and there the asymptotic regime transverse to the wall corresponds to the boundary of the AdS spacetime. We also comment on the possibility that the massive breathing mode may, in the case of fundamental domain-wall sources, stabilize such walls via a Goldberger-Wise mechanism.",M. Cvetic; H. Lu; C. N.

We perform least squares fits of the DIRBE diffuse IR intensities to the 21-cm line and radio continuum intensities.

Grains within BL are warmer than in HI regions. Trapped L-alpha accounts for the extra heating that is required.

If the halo pattern speed is initially retrograde and slowly decays to zero, stars can be trapped as the Binney resonance sweeps past them, and levitated into polar orbits. If the halo pattern speed is initially retrograde and slowly changes to prograde, trapped stars can evolve from prograde to retrograde disk orbits.

astro-ph/0001026v3,The Central X-Ray Point Source in Cassiopeia A,"The spectacular first light observation by the Chandra X-Ray Observatory revealed an X-ray point source near the center of the 300 yr old Cas A supernova remnant. We present an analysis of the public X-ray spectral and timing data. No coherent pulsations were detected in the Chandra/HRC data. The 3-sigma upper limit on the pulsed fraction is <35% for P>20 ms. The Chandra/ACIS spectrum of the point source may be fit with an ideal blackbody (kT=0.5 keV), or with BB models modified by the presence of a NS atmosphere (kT=0.25-0.35 keV), but the temperature is higher and the inferred emitting area lower than expected for a 300 yr old NS according to standard cooling models. The spectrum may also be fit with a power law model (photon index 2.8-3.6). Both the spectral properties and the timing limits of the point source are inconsistent with a young Crab-like pulsar, but are quite similar to the properties of the anomalous X-ray pulsars. The spectral parameters are also very similar to those of the other radio-quiet X-ray point sources in the supernova remnants Pup A, RCW 103, and PKS 1209-52. Current limits on an optical counterpart for the Cas A point source rule out models that invoke fallback accretion onto a compact object if fallback disk properties are similar to those in quiescent low-mass X-ray binaries. However, the optical limits are marginally consistent with plausible alternative assumptions for a fallback disk. In this case, accreting NS models can explain the X-ray data, but an accreting BH model is not promising.",Deepto Chakrabarty; Michael J. Pivovaroff; Lars E. Hernquist; Jeremy S.

astro-ph/0001027v1,Is Thermal Instability Significant in Turbulent Galactic Gas?,"We investigate numerically the role of thermal instability (TI) as a generator of density structures in the interstellar medium (ISM), both by itself and in the context of a globally turbulent medium. Simulations of the instability alone show that the condenstion process which forms a dense phase (``clouds'') is highly dynamical, and that the boundaries of the clouds are accretion shocks, rather than static density discontinuities. The density histograms (PDFs) of these runs exhibit either bimodal shapes or a single peak at low densities plus a slope change at high densities. Final static situations may be established, but the equilibrium is very fragile: small density fluctuations in the warm phase require large variations in the density of the cold phase, probably inducing shocks into the clouds. This result suggests that such configurations are highly unlikely. Simulations including turbulent forcing show that large- scale forcing is incapable of erasing the signature of the TI in the density PDFs, but small-scale, stellar-like forcing causes erasure of the signature of the instability. However, these simulations do not reach stationary regimes, TI driving an ever-increasing star formation rate. Simulations including magnetic fields, self-gravity and the Coriolis force show no significant difference between the PDFs of stable and unstable cases, and reach stationary regimes, suggesting that the combination of the stellar forcing and the extra effective pressure provided by the magnetic field and the Coriolis force overwhelm TI as a density-structure generator in the ISM. We emphasize that a multi-modal temperature PDF is not necessarily an indication of a multi-phase medium, which must contain clearly distinct thermal equilibrium phases.",Enrique Vázquez-Semadeni; Adriana Gazol; John Scalo,astro-ph,astro-ph

  in D-brane Matrix Models","It is known that when there are several D-branes, their space-time coordinates in general become noncommutative. From the point of view of noncommutative geometry, it reflects noncommutativity of the world volume of the D-branes. On the other hand, as we showed in the previous work, in the presence of the constant antisymmetric tensor field the momentum operators of the D-branes have noncommutative structure. In the present paper, we investigate a relation between these noncommutativities and the description of D-branes in terms of the noncommutative Yang-Mills theory recently proposed by Seiberg and Witten. It is shown that the noncommutativity of the Yang-Mills theory, which implies that of the world volume coordinates, originates from both noncommutativities of the transverse coordinates and momenta from the viewpoint of the lower-dimensional D-branes. Moreover, we show that this noncommutativity is transformed by coordinate transformations on the world volume and thereby can be chosen in an arbitrary fixed value.

The effect of the Coulomb correlation between Co 3d electrons is also explored with the LSDA + U method.

What makes this discovery particularly noteworthy is the fact that the Type 2 classification of this Seyfert galaxy has resulted directly from the X-ray data and has been confirmed by optical spectroscopy only subsequently. The X-ray spectrum of AXJ2254+1146 is best described by a model consisting of an unresolved Gaussian line at $6.43\pm 0.1$ keV plus the so called ""leaky-absorber"" continua having an intrinsic power law photon index of $\Gamma$ = $2.51^{2.76}_{2.17}$ (1 $\sigma$ confidence interval).

astro-ph/0001032v1,"Limits on the Spatial Extent of AGN Measured with the Fine Guidance
  Sensors of the HST",The optical structure of several AGN has been studied using the Fine Guidance Sensors (FGS) on the Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The FGSs are interferometric devices which can resolve structure on scales of 20 milliarcsecs or less and hence have the potential to improve on the resolution attainable by HST's cameras. The FGSs produce interferometric fringes known as S-curves which are related to the intensity profile of the object on the sky. These have been analyzed using a simple model for the radial intensity distribution and strength of the underlying background illumination of the observed objects. Eight different observations of six different AGN have been analyzed. No statistically significant differences from point sources are detected but significant upper limits of order 20 milliarcseconds are placed on any spatial extent. Systematic effects limiting the resolution are discussed and some simple conclusions about the physical size and luminosity densities of the emitting regions of the AGN implied by the data are given.,Richard N.

The resonating group method and the generating coordinate method rely on a property of the norm kernel, which introduces some of the ghost states. The norm kernel has been usually calculated under the assumption that the inner wavefunctions have a simple Gaussian form. It is the first time that this assumption is tested by the rigorous way. In the 4He+N system, we demonstrate a ghost state, which is calculated from a rigorous solution of Yakubovsky equations for the alpha particle.

astro-ph/0001033v1,Radio emission of the Galactic X-rays binaries with relativistic jets,"Variable non-thermal radio emission from Galactic X-ray binaries is a trace of relativistic jets, created near accretion disks. The spectral characteristics of a lot of radio flares in the X-ray binaries with jets (RJXB) is discussed in this report. We carried out several long daily monitoring programs with the RATAN-600 radio telescope of the sources: SS433, Cyg X-3, LSI+61o303, GRS 1915+10 and some others. We also reviewed some data from the GBI monitoring program at two frequencies and hard X-ray BATSE (20-100 keV) and soft X-ray RTXE (2-12 keV) ASM data. We confirmed that flaring radio emission of Cyg X-3 correlated with hard and anti-correlated with soft X-ray emission during the strong flare (>$ Jy) in May 1997. During two orbital periods we investigated radio light curves of the remarkable X-binary LSI+61o303. Two flaring events near a phase 0.6 of the 26.5-day orbital period have been detected for first time at four frequencies simultaneously. Powerful flaring events of SS433 were detected at six frequencies in May 1996 and in May 1999. The decay of the flare is exactly fitted by an exponential law and the rate of the decay $\tau$ depends upon frequency as tau \propto \nu^{-0.4} in the first flare and does not depend upon frequency in the second flare, and is equal to \tau=6+-1 days at frequencies from 0.96 to 21.7 GHz in the last flare in May 1999. Many flaring RJXB show two, exponential and power, laws of flare decay. Moreover, these different laws could be present in one or several flares and commonly flare decays are faster at a higher frequency. The decay law seems to change because of geometric form of the conical hollow jets. The synchrotron and inverse Compton losses could explain general frequency dependences in flare evolution. In conclusion we summarized the general radio properties of RJXB.",S. A. Trushkin,astro-ph,astro-ph

The abundance of the latter three species relative to 12CO are 4 10^{-2}, 8 10^{-4} and 4.5 (approximate value) in the regions where they are produced. We suggest that O-bearing species other than CO are produced in the innermost region of the circumstellar envelope. The UV photons from the central star photodissociate most of the molecular species produced in the AGB phase and allow a chemistry dominated by standard ion-neutral reactions. Not only allow these reactions the formation of O-bearing species, but they also modify the abundances of C-rich molecules like HCN and HNC for which we found an abundance ratio of roughly 1, much lower than in AGB stars.

The traditional Cooper pairing is obtained by taking into account the double-electron exchange between the nearest neighbours within the two-dimensional CuO_2 plane. The equation for the superconducting gap is obtained as a result of the standard BCS treatment. It is shown that the order parameter could have either s-type or d-type symmetry depending on the ratio between the transition amplitudes.

The study of these objects is possible only at energies where the effects of absorption are less severe. For this reason we have carried out the BeppoSAX High Energy LLarge Area Survey in the hardest band (5-10 keV) accessible so far with imaging X-ray instruments. The source surface density at the survey limiting flux accounts for a significant fraction (20-30%) of the hard XRB. The X-ray data complemented by multiwavelength follow--up observations suggest that a large fraction of the hard sources are AGN and that X-ray absorption with column densities in the range 10^22-23.5 cm-2 is common among them. The great diversity in their optical-near-IR properties suggests that the optical appearance of obscured sources is a function of the X-ray luminosity.

hep-th/0001014v1,Gauge theories in local causal perturbation theory,"In this thesis quantum gauge theories are considered in the framework of local, causal perturbation theory. Gauge invariance is described in terms of the BRS formalism. Local interacting field operators are constructed perturbatively and field equations are established. A nilpotent BRS transformation is defined on the local algebra of fields. It allows the definition of the algebra of local observables as an operator cohomology. This algebra of local observables can be represented in a Hilbert space.   The interacting field operators are defined in terms of time ordered products of free field operators. For the results above to hold the time ordered products must satisfy certain normalization conditions. To formulate these conditions also for field operators that contain a spacetime derivative a suitable mathematical description of time ordered products is developed.   Among the normalization conditions are Ward identities for the ghost current and the BRS current. The latter are generalizations of a normalization condition that is postulated by D""utsch, Hurth, Krahe and Scharf for Yang-Mills theory. It is not yet proven that this condition has a solution in every order. All other normalization conditions can be accomplished simultaneously.   A principle for the correspondence between interacting quantum fields and interacting classical fields is established.

We consider three flat cosmological models: CDM, LCDM($\Omega_\Lambda = 0.7$) and CHDM($\Omega_h = 0.2$, 1 massive $\nu$), all normalized so to fit the observed number of clusters. For each model we built 40 clusters, using a TREESPH code, and performed a statistical comparison with a data sample including nearby clusters observed with ROSAT PSPC instrument. The comparison disfavors the LCDM model, as clusters appear too relaxed, while CDM and CHDM clusters, in which a higher degree of complexity occurs, seem to be closer to observations. A better fit of data can be expected for some different DM mix. If DM distributions are used instead of baryons, we find substructures more pronounced than in gas and models have a different score.

The validity of this equation for a finite-thickness film is verified by a numerical analysis. An approximation dependence $\bar A(y)$, finite (with all of its derivatives) across the entire film width, is found for films, being in the Meissner state. The flux-entry field is evaluated for a film of arbitrary thickness. An approximation expression is obtained for the distribution of the sheet current density in the mixed state of a pin-free superconducting film with an edge barrier.

It is found that $\bar K^0$ condensation is quite sensitive to the antikaon optical potential and depends more strongly on the nucleonic equation of state. For moderate values of antikaon potential and a rather stiff equation of state, a significant region of maximum mass star will contain $\bar K^0$ meson. The critical density of $\bar K^0$ condensation is always higher than that of $K^-$ condensation. With the appearance of $K^-$ and $\bar K^0$ condensates, pairs of $p-K^-$ and $n-\bar K^0$ are produced with equal proportion leading to a perfectly symmetric matter of nucleons and antikaons in neutron stars.

These data increase the number of certain (or probable) Local Group members to 36. The spatial distribution of these galaxies supports Hubble's claim that the Local Group ``is isolated in the general field.'' Presently available evidence suggests that star formation continued much longer in many dwarf spheroidals than it did in the main body of the Galactic halo. It is suggested that ``young'' globular clusters, such as Ruprecht 106, might have formed in now defunct dwarf spheroidals.

Specifically, we study how an upper cut on the invariant mass spectrum, which is necessary to extract V_{ub}, results in the breakdown of the standard perturbative expansion due to the existence of large infrared logs. We first show how the decay rate factorizes at the level of the double differential distribution. Then, we present closed form expressions for the resummed cut rate for the inclusive decays B -> X_s gamma and B -> X_u e nu at next-to-leading order in the infrared logs. Using these results, we determine the range of cuts for which resummation is necessary, as well as the range for which the resummed expansion itself breaks down. We also use our results to extract the leading and next to leading infrared log contribution to the two loop differential rate. We find that for the phenomenologically interesting cut values, there is only a small region where the calculation is under control. Furthermore, the size of this region is sensitive to the parameter \bar{\Lambda}. We discuss the viability of extracting V_{ub} from the hadronic mass spectrum.",Adam K. Leibovich; Ian Low; I. Z.

There are two types of solution, determined by the solution's behaviour at jump times of the process X, one we call geometric the other forward. The geometric solution is obtained by adding fictitious time and solving an associated integral equation. The forward solution is derived from the geometric solution by correcting the solution's jump behaviour. L\'evy processes, generally, have unbounded variation. So we must use a pathwise integral different from the Lebesgue-Stieltjes integral. When X has finite p-variation almost surely for p<2 we use Young's integral. This is defined whenever f and g have finite p and q-variation for 1/p+1/q>1 (and they have no common discontinuities). When p>2 we use the integral of Lyons.

  Quatum Hall State and the Phase Diagram at $ν= 2$","We consider the effect of interactions on electrons confined to two dimensions at Landau level filling $\nu=2$, with the specific aim to determine the range of parameters where the fully polarized state is stable. We calculate the charge and the spin density collective modes in random phase approximation (RPA) including vertex corrections (also known as time dependent Hartree Fock), and treating the Landau level mixing accurately within the subspace of a single particle hole pair. It is found that the spin wave excitation mode of the fully polarized state has a roton minimum which deepens as a result of the interaction induced Landau level mixing, and the energy of the roton vanishes at a critical Zeeman energy signaling an instability of the fully polarized state at still lower Zeeman energies. The feasibility of the experimental observation of the roton minimum in the spin wave mode and its softening will be discussed. The spin and charge density collective modes of the unpolarized state are also considered, and a phase diagram for the $\nu =2$ state as a function of $r_{S}$ and the Zeeman energy is obtained.",K.

  Potentials","We introduce a class of eccentric discs with ""strong"" density cusps whose potentials are of St\""ackel form in elliptic coordinates. Our models exhibit some striking features: sufficiently close to the location of the cusp, the potential and surface density distribution diverge as $\Phi \propto r^{-1}$ and $\Sigma \propto r^{-2}$, respectively. As we move outward from the centre, the model takes a non-axisymmetric, lopsided structure. In the limit, when $r$ tends to infinity, the isocontours of $\Phi$ and $\Sigma$ become spherically symmetric. It is shown that the configuration space is occupied by three families of regular orbits: {\it eccentric butterfly}, {\it aligned loop} and {\it horseshoe} orbits. These orbits are properly aligned with the surface density distribution and can be used to construct self-consistent equilibrium states.",M. A. Jalali; A. R. Rafiee,astro-ph,astro-ph

Symmetries are classified into orthochronous (those preserving the `temporal order' of `events') and nonorthochronous. A straightforward criterion for physical equivalence of histories is formulated in terms of orthochronous symmetries; this criterion covers various notions of physical equivalence of histories considered by Gell-Mann and Hartle as special cases. In familiar situations, a reciprocal relationship between traditional symmetries (Wigner symmetries in quantum mechanics and Borel-measurable transformations of phase space in classical mechanics) and symmetries defined in this work is established. In a restricted class of theories, a definition of conservation law is given in the history language which agrees with the standard ones in familiar situations; in a smaller subclass of theories, a Noether type theorem (implying a connection between continuous symmetries of dynamics and conservation laws) is proved. The formalism evolved is applied to histories (of particles, fields or more general objects) in general curved spacetimes. Sharpening the definition of symmetry so as to include a continuity requirement, it is shown that a symmetry in our formalism implies a conformal isometry of the spacetime metric.",Tulsi Dass; Y. N.

Our results show that a random distribution of unitary impurities of any concentration can at most give rise to a finite zero-bias conductance (with no peak there) in spatially-averaged non-STM type of tunneling, in spite of the fact that local tunneling in the immediate vicinity of an isolated impurity does show a conductance peak at zero bias, whereas to give rise to even a small zero-bias conductance peak in the former type of tunneling the impurities must form dimers, trimers, etc. along the [110] directions. In addition, we find that the most-recently-observed novel pattern of the tunneling conductance around a single impurity by Pan et al. [Nature (London) 403,746 (2000)] can be explained in terms of a realistic model of the tunneling configuration which gives rise to the experimental results reported there.

  in the pseudogap regime of the cuprates","Andreev interferometry - the sensitivity of the tunneling current to spatial variations in the local superconducting order at an interface - is proposed as a probe of the spatial structure of the phase correlations in the pseudogap state of the cuprate superconductors. To demonstrate this idea theoretically, a simple tunneling model is considered, via which the tunneling current is related to the equilibrium phase-phase correlator in the pseudogap state. These considerations suggest that measurement of the low-voltage conductance through mesoscopic contacts of varying areas provides a scheme for accessing phase-phase correlation information. For illustrative purposes, quantitative predictions are made for a model of the pseudogap state in which the phase (but not the amplitude) of the superconducting order varies randomly, and does so with correlations consistent with certain proposed pictures of the pseudogap state.",Daniel E.

Suppose that initially there are infinitely many walkers on the non-negative even integer sites. At each tick of time, each walker moves either to its left or to its right with equal probability. The only constraint is that no two walkers can occupy the same site at the same time. It is proved that in the large time limit, a certain conditional probability of the displacement of the leftmost walker is identical to the limiting distribution of the properly scaled largest eigenvalue of a random GOE matrix (GOE Tracy-Widom distribution). The proof is based on the bijection between path configurations and semistandard Young tableaux established recently by Guttmann, Owczarek and Viennot. Statistics of semistandard Young tableaux is analyzed using the Hankel determinant expression for the probability from the work of Rains and the author.

  Effect","We present gri CCD photometry of 44 Abell clusters and 4 cluster candidates. Twenty one clusters in our sample have spectroscopic redshifts. Fitting a relation between mean g, r and i magnitudes, and redshift for this subsample, we have calculated photometric redshifts for the remainder with an estimated accuracy of 0.03. The resulting redshift range for the sample is 0.03<z<0.38. Color-magnitude diagrams are presented for the complete sample and used to study evolution of the galaxy population in the cluster environment. Our observations show a strong Butcher-Oemler effect (Butcher & Oemler 1978, 1984), with an increase in the fraction of blue galaxies (f_B) with redshift that seems more consistent with the steeper relation estimated by Rakos and Schombert (1995) than with the original one by Butcher & Oemler (1984). However, in the redshift range between ~ 0.08 and 0.2, where most of our clusters lie, there is a wide range of f_B values, consistent with no redshift evolution of the cluster galaxy population. A large range of f_B values is also seen between ~ 0.2 and 0.3, when Smail at al. (1998) x-ray clusters are added to our sample. The discrepancies between samples underscore the need for an unbiased sample to understand how much of the Butcher-Oemler effect is due to evolution, and how much to selection effects. We also tested the idea proposed by Garilli et al. (1996) that there is a population of unusually red galaxies which could be associated either with the field or clusters, but we find that these objects are all near the limiting magnitude of the images (20.5<r<22) and have colors that are consistent with those expected for stars or field galaxies at z ~ 0.7.",V.

Previous single-dish observations revealed that almost all of the CO emission arises from a central ring or bar-like structure of length $\sim$ 4 kpc. We confirm this structure at higher resolution, and find that it is bent at the center, reflecting the overall bend in this galaxy apparent from optical images. The kinematic evidence favors a rigidly rotating ring over a bar. The gaseous halo emission in several tracers is concentrated above and below this molecular structure. To the north of an emission peak at the eastern end of the structure is an extraplanar feature showing filamentary and shell-like properties which we interpret as an energetic molecular outflow. The energies involved are difficult to estimate, but are probably of order 10$^{54}$ ergs or more. The CO concentration in the disk below this structure coincides with a bright HII region complex, a peak of radio emission, and the brightest X-ray feature in the inner disk of the galaxy seen in a ROSAT HRI map, all suggesting intense star formation.

Here we show that the impending identification of the location of the {\it second} peak in the CMB power spectrum will provide an immediate and independent probe of the dark-energy density.

The pairing matrix elements are written as a separable part plus a remainder that vanishes when either momentum variable is on the Fermi surface. This decomposition effects a separation of the problem of determining the dependence of the gap components in a spin-angle representation on the magnitude of the momentum (described by a set of functions independent of magnetic quantum number) from the problem of determining the dependence of the gap on angle or magnetic projection. The former problem is solved through a set of nonsingular, quasilinear integral equations, providing inputs for solution of the latter problem through a coupled system of algebraic equations for a set of numerical coefficients. An incisive criterion is given for finding the upper critical density for closure of the triplet gap. The separation method and its development for triplet pairing exploit the existence of a small parameter, given by a gap-amplitude measure divided by the Fermi energy. The revised BCS equations admit analysis revealing universal properties of the full set of solutions for $^3$P$_2$ pairing in the absence of tensor coupling, referring especially to the energy degeneracy and energetic order of these solutions.

Both hard X-ray and radio emissions are luminous only while signatures of merging events are clearly seen in thermal intracluster medium (ICM). On the other hand, EUV radiation is still luminous after the system has relaxed. Propagation of shock waves and bulk-flow motion of ICM play crucial roles to extend radio halos.

The global features for the $\eta$ parameters as a function of $\beta$ and the coefficient $C_{1}$ have been clarified. It has been found by the perturbative analysis that as $C_1$ decreases, the slope of the $\eta(\beta)$ becomes less steep and for the actions whose $C_{1}$ is less than -0.160, $\eta$ decreases as $\beta$ decreases, contrary to the case of the standard action. In the medium to strong coupling region, the $\eta$ parameter begins to increase as $\beta$ decreases for all $C_{1}$. This means that for the actions with $C_{1} < -0.160$, the one-loop perturbative results for $\eta$ break down qualitatively and the $\eta$ parameters have a dip.

The discovery of strong non-thermal X-ray emission from the northwest part of the remnant strongly suggests the existence of electrons with energies up to 100 TeV in the remnant, making the SNR a good candidate TeV gamma-ray source. We observed RXJ1713.7-3946 from May to August 1998 with the CANGAROO 3.8m atmospheric imaging Cerenkov telescope and obtained evidence for TeV gamma-ray emission from the NW rim of the remnant with the significance of 5.6 sigma.

The data indicate that the emitting region is much broader than the point spread function of our telescope. The extent of the emission is consistent with that of hard X-rays observed by ASCA.

cond-mat/0001043v1,Escape of a chain molecule over a barrier - the kink mechanism,"We consider the generalization of the Kramers escape over a barrier problem to the case of a long chain molecule. The problem involves the motion of a chain molecule of $N$ segments across a region where the free energy per segment is higher, so that it has to cross a barrier. We consider the limit where the length of the molecule is much larger than the width of the barrier. The width is taken to be sufficiently wide that a coninuum description is applicable to even to the portion over the barrier. We use the Rouse model and analyze the mechanism of crossing a barrier. There can be two dominant mechanisms. They are: end crossing and hairpin crossing. We find the free energy of activation for the hairpin crossing is two times that for end crossing. In both cases, the activation energy has a square root dependence on the temperature $T$, leading to a non-Arrhenius form for the rate. We also show that there is a special time dependent solution of the model, which corresponds to a kink in the chain, confined to the region of the barrier. The movement of the polymer from one side to the other is equivalent to the motion of the kink on the chain in the reverse direction. We also consider the translocation of hydrophilic polypeptides across hydrophobic pores, a process that is quite common in biological systems. Biological systems accomplish this by having a hydrophobic signal sequence at the end that goes in first. We find that for such a molecule, the transition state resembles a hook, and this is in agreement with presently accepted view in cell biology.",K. L. Sebastian; Alok K. R.

astro-ph/0001049v2,"The Rise Times of High and Low Redshift Type Ia Supernovae are
  Consistent","We present a self-consistent comparison of the rise times for low- and high-redshift Type Ia supernovae. Following previous studies, the early light curve is modeled using a t-squared law, which is then mated with a modified Leibundgut template light curve. The best-fit t-squared law is determined for ensemble samples of low- and high-redshift supernovae by fitting simultaneously for all light curve parameters for all supernovae in each sample. Our method fully accounts for the non-negligible covariance amongst the light curve fitting parameters, which previous analyses have neglected. Contrary to Riess et al. (1999), we find fair to good agreement between the rise times of the low- and high-redshift Type Ia supernovae. The uncertainty in the rise time of the high-redshift Type Ia supernovae is presently quite large (roughly +/- 1.2 days statistical), making any search for evidence of evolution based on a comparison of rise times premature. Furthermore, systematic effects on rise time determinations from the high-redshift observations, due to the form of the late-time light curve and the manner in which the light curves of these supernovae were sampled, can bias the high-redshift rise time determinations by up to +3.6/-1.9 days under extreme situations. The peak brightnesses - used for cosmology - do not suffer any significant bias, nor any significant increase in uncertainty.",Greg Aldering; Robert Knop; Peter Nugent,astro-ph,astro-ph

The remaining one target shows no H$\alpha$ emission in spite of its bright rest-UV luminosity, indicating that this object is already under the post-starburst phase.

The value of the calculated dimensionless total electron-phonon coupling constant is $\lambda\approx0.1$, an order of magnitude smaller than in C$_{60}$, consistent with the lack of a superconducting phase transition in C$_{70}$A$_3$ fullerite, and in overall agreement with measurements of the broadening of Raman peaks in C$_{70}$K$_4$.

Details of these correlations are explored and their sensitivity to the underlying nucleon-nucleon interaction.

astro-ph/0001053v1,On the FIR emission from intracluster dust,"We make predictions for the diffuse far-infrared (FIR) emission from dust in the intracluster medium (ICM) of the Virgo cluster using detailed information on potential dust sources, grain heating and sputtering rates available for this cluster from recent optical and X-ray studies. We show that the infrared emission from dust injected by sources inside the core region of the Virgo cluster is a factor of 10 below the detection limit of currently available telescopes. The outer regions of dynamically young clusters like the Virgo cluster have a further potential source of intracluster grains since they are still accreting freshly infalling spiral galaxies which are presumably contained in an accreting intergalactic medium (IGM). We show that cosmic ray driven winds from the infalling spirals can inject grains into a subvirial IGM that is external to the observed X-ray-emitting ICM. Sputtering during the injection process and in the IGM is weak, so that the injected grains should accumulate in the IGM until the infall brings them into contact with the hot ICM. This effect dominates the dust injection rate from known sources embedded in the hot Virgo ICM. Thus, any detection of diffuse IR emission would probe the current dust accretion rate for the cluster, acting as an indicator of the youth and the dynamical state of the cluster. The predictions for the Virgo cluster are generalised to other clusters and the possibility of detection of dynamically young clusters at cosmological distances is discussed.",Cristina C.

nucl-th/0001008v2,Aspects of thermal and chemical equilibration of hadronic matter,"We study thermal and chemical equilibration in 'infinite' hadron matter as well as in finite size relativistic nucleus-nucleus collisions using a BUU cascade transport model that contains resonance and string degrees-of-freedom. The 'infinite' hadron matter is simulated within a cubic box with periodic boundary conditions. The various equilibration times depend on baryon density and energy density and are much shorter for particles consisting of light quarks then for particles including strangeness. For kaons and antikaons the chemical equilibration time is found to be larger than $\simeq$ 40 fm/c for all baryon and energy densities considered. The inclusion of continuum excitations, i.e. hadron 'strings', leads to a limiting temperature of $T_s\simeq$ 150 MeV. We, furthermore, study the expansion of a hadronic fireball after equilibration. The slope parameters of the particles after expansion increase with their mass; the pions leave the fireball much faster then nucleons and accelerate subsequently heavier hadrons by rescattering ('pion wind'). If the system before expansion is close to the limiting temperature $T_s$, the slope parameters for all particles after expansion practically do not depend on (initial) energy and baryon density. Finally, the equilibration in relativistic nucleus-nucleus collision is considered. Since the reaction time here is much shorter than the equilibration time for strangeness, a chemical equilibrium of strange particles in heavy-ion collisions is not supported by our transport calculations.

Both the experimental and theoretical hints in favor of Fermi level located in a Cu or O band, respectively, are considered. For these two alternatives analytical expressions are obtained for the LCAO electron wave functions suitable for the treatment of electron superexchange. Simple formulae for the Fermi surface and electron dispersions are derived by applying the Loewdin down-fold procedure to set up the effective copper and oxygen Hamiltonians. They are used to fit the experimental ARUPS Fermi surface of Pb_0.42Bi_1.73Sr_1.94Ca_1.3Cu_1.92O_8+x and both the ARPES and LDA Fermi surface of Nd_2-xCe_xCuO_4-delta.

New information about interstellar absorption lines of CII, CII*, NI and OI from this spectrum are combined with the HST results reported by Dupin & Gry (1998) to arrive at new conclusions about the physical properties of the absorbing gas in front of beta CMa. For two prominent velocity components centered at heliocentric velocities of +20.0 and +30.5 km/s, designated by Dupin & Gry as Components C and D respectively, we use determinations of N(CII*)/N(CII) and N(MgI)/N(MgII) to solve for temperatures and electron densities. From our knowledge that oxygen and nitrogen have their ionizations coupled to that of hydrogen through charge exchange reactions, we can derive the hydrogen ionizations by comparing these elements to sulfur, which is likely not to be depleted onto dust grains. For Component C with an approximate column density of neutral and ionized hydrogen N(Htotal)=6 10^{18} cm^-2, we find that the neutral fraction n(HI)/n(Htotal)=0.25, 400<T<6500 K, and 0.08<n(e)<0.6 cm^-3, while for Component D with N(Htotal)=1.2 10^{19}cm^-2, we arrive at n(HI)/n(Htotal)=0.035, 8000<T<14000 K, and 0.09<n(e)<0.2cm^-3.

astro-ph/0001060v1,On the Interpretation of the Optical Spectra of L-type Dwarfs,"We present synthetic optical spectra in the range 640-930 nm of a sample of field L dwarfs and the brown dwarf GL229B. Our computations show that Li, Na, K, Rb, and Cs govern the spectra of these objects, with Na and K contributing significantly to block the optical emergent radiation. Molecular absorptions of TiO, VO, CrH, FeH and CaH also dominate in the early L-types showing a strength that progressively decreases for later types. We find that the densities of these molecules in the atmospheres are considerably smaller by larger factors than those predicted by the chemical equilibrium. In order to reproduce the overall shape of the optical spectra an additional opacity (AdO) is required to be implemented in the computations. We have modelled it with a simple law [a0 (nu / nu0)^N, N=4], and found that this provides a good fit to the data. This AdO could be due to molecular/dust absorption or to dust scattering. The EWs and intensities of the alkali lines are highly affected by this opacity. The Li line at 670.8 nm, widely used as a substellarity discriminator, is more affected by the AdO than by the natural depletion of neutral Li. Our computations display a rather strong feature even at Teffs around 1000 K; depending on the Teff and on the amount of dust in the atmospheres of very cool dwarfs, it might be possible to detect Li even at temperatures this cool.

The object, SDSS J134646.45-003150.4 (SDSS 1346-00), was selected because of its very red color and stellar appearance. Its spectrum between 0.8-2.5 mic is dominated by strong absorption bands of H_2O and CH_4 and closely mimics those of Gliese 229B and SDSS 162414.37+002915.6 (SDSS 1624+00), two other known methane brown dwarfs. SDSS 1346-00 is approximately 1.5 mag fainter than Gliese 229B, suggesting that it lies about 11 pc from the sun. The ratio of flux at 2.1 mic to that at 1.27 mic is larger for SDSS 1346-00 than for Gliese 229B and SDSS 1624+00, which suggests that SDSS 1346-00 has a slightly higher effective temperature than the others. Based on a search area of 130 sq. deg. and a detection limit of z* = 19.8, we estimate a space density of 0.05 pc^-3 for methane brown dwarfs with T_eff ~ 1000 K in the 40 pc^3 volume of our search.

The 6"" error circle contains two OGLE microlensing optical variables of which one has previously been identified with a 14.5 mag Be-type star in the Small Magellanic Cloud. During the October 1996 observation RXJ0052.1-7319 was found to be extremely bright (with a count rate of ~1.1+/-0.1 s^-1) and 15.3 second X-ray pulsations have been discovered during this observation. This indicates for a high-mass X-ray binary nature of the source. During the 1995 observation the X-ray source detected at the position of RXJ0052.1-7319 was a factor 200 fainter. The corresponding luminosity has changed from 5.2x10^37 erg s^-1 to 2.6x10^35 erg s^-1 assuming SMC membership of the source.

cond-mat/0001046v1,Extended d_{x^2 - y^2}-wave superconductivity,"Remarkable anisotropic structures have been recently observed in the order parameter Delta_k of the underdoped superconductor Bi-2212. Such findings are strongly suggestive of deviations from a simple d_{x^2 - y^2}-wave picture of high-Tc superconductivity, i.e. Delta_k ~ cos (k_x) - cos (k_y). In particular, flatter nodes in Delta_k are observed along the k_x = (+/-) k_y directions in k-space, than within this simple model for a d-wave gap. We argue that nonlinear corrections in the k-dependence of Delta_k near the nodes introduce new energy scales, which would lead to deviations in the predicted power-law asymptotic behaviour of several measurable quantities, at low or intermediate temperatures. We evaluate such deviations, either analytically or numerically, within the interlayer pair-tunneling model, and within yet another phenomenological model for a d-wave order parameter. We find that such deviations are expected to be of different sign in the two cases. Moreover, the doping dependence of the flatness of the gap near the nodes is also attributable to Fermi surface effects, in addition to possible screening effects modifying the in-plane pairing kernel, as recently proposed.",Giuseppe G.

In both models, the Yukawa couplings that involve the new scalar and the neutrinos could be of order one.

We have found a linear dependence of lambda_ab in all samples with a rapidly increasing slope dlambda_ab/dT as doping decreases. Our analysis of the data indicates that a superconducting gap with d-wave symmetry is sufficient to quantitatively account for the above slope values in the optimally or over- doped samples. In the underdoped samples, the d-wave model predicts much smaller values than those measured by assuming realistic values for the zero-temperature lambda_ab and gap delta. The experimental data are compatible with a model of thermodynamic phase fluctuations of the order parameter.

Limitations of actual model atmospheres when fine precision is required for the calculations of partial derivatives and integrals, which depend on limb darkening coefficients, are discussed. Two methods are discussed to calculate the phase lags, the angle between maximum temperature and minimum radius, and R, a parameter which describes departure from adiabaticity of the atmospheres of these pulsating stars. These quantities appear to be very dependent on the convection as parametrized by the mixing length theory. When one of the methods is applied to the gamma Dor stars gives phase lags close to 0 degrees, which are 90-180 degrees out of phase from typical delta Scuti stars. Examples are given for some High Amplitude Delta Scuti Stars (HADS) where the method can be easily applied and gives results consistent to interpret them as radial (l=0) pulsating stars. Other low amplitude delta Scuti stars could be oscillating in a non-radial (l=1, 2) mode. Multi-band photometry is concluded to be a very powerful tool for mode identification of delta Scuti and gamma Dor stars, specially with the more accurate photometry that will be achieved in the near future with the asteroseismological space missions now in progress.",Rafael Garrido,astro-ph,astro-ph

We investigate the effect of rotation on the effective temperature and luminosity of these stars. We find that the decrease in T_eff and L can be significant at the higher end of our mass range, but becomes negligible below 0.4 M_sun. Formulae for relating T_eff to mass and v_rot are presented.   We compare our models to rotational data from young open clusters of different ages to infer the rotational history of low mass stars, and the dependence of initial conditions and rotational evolution on mass. We find that the qualitative conclusions for stars below 0.6 M_sun do not depend on the assumptions about internal angular momentum transport, which makes these low mass stars ideal candidates for the study of the angular momentum loss law and distribution of initial conditions. We find that neither models with solid body nor differential rotation can simultaneously reproduce the observed stellar spin down in the 0.6 to 1.1 M_sun mass range and for stars between 0.1 and 0.6 M_sun. The most likely explanation is that the saturation threshold drops more steeply at low masses than would be predicted with a simple Rossby scaling. In young clusters there is a systematic increase in the mean rotation rate with decreased temperature below 3500 K (0.4 M_sun). This suggests either inefficient angular momentum loss or mass-dependent initial conditions for stars near the fully convective boundary. (abridged)",Alison Sills; M. H. Pinsonneault; D. M.

I calculate the parton densities to be used by the event generator in terms of MSbar densities. The method is generalizable. A particular motivation for treating the gluon-fusion process is to treat diffractive deep-inelastic scattering properly, since in diffractive scattering the gluon density dominates the quark densities. I also propose a modified algorithm for treating parton kinematics in event generators; the new algorithm results in much simpler formulae for the NLO corrections. A disadvantage of the new method is that some of the generated events may have negative weights. However, an adjustable cut-off function is present in the formalism, and this permits a renormalization-group-like transformation that can be used to at least reduce the proportion of events with negative weights.",John Collins,hep-ph,hep-ph

astro-ph/0001066v2,"Generation of the Primordial Magnetic Fields during Cosmological
  Reionization","We investigate the generation of magnetic field by the Biermann battery in cosmological ionization fronts, using new simulations of the reionization of the universe by stars in protogalaxies. Two mechanisms are primarily responsible for magnetogenesis: i) the breakout of I-fronts from protogalaxies, and ii) the propagation of I-fronts through the high density neutral filaments which are part of the cosmic web. The first mechanism is dominant prior to overlapping of ionized regions (z ~ 7), whereas the second continues to operate even after that epoch. However, after overlap the field strength increase is largely due to the gas compression occurring as cosmic structures form. As a consequence, the magnetic field at z ~ 5 closely traces the gas density, and it is highly ordered on megaparsec scales. The mean mass-weighted field strength is B_0 ~ 10^{-19} G in the simulation box. There is a relatively well-defined, nearly linear correlation between B_0 and the baryonic mass of virialized objects, with B_0 ~ 10^{-18} G in the most massive objects (M ~ 10^9 M_sun) in our simulations. This is a lower limit, as lack of numerical resolution prevents us from following small scale dynamical processes which could amplify the field in protogalaxies. Although the field strengths we compute are probably adequate as seed fields for a galactic dynamo, the field is too small to have had significant effects on galaxy formation, on thermal conduction, or on cosmic ray transport in the intergalactic medium. It could, however, be observed in the intergalactic medium through innovative methods based on analysis of gamma-ray burst photon arrival times.",Nickolay Y. Gnedin; Andrea Ferrara; Ellen G.

A key parameter of the model is the jet-side of the double sources, which is estimated for 80% of the FRII sources in the 3CRR complete sample. Statistical analyses of the properties of these sources show that the asymmetric model is in agreement with a wide range of observational data, and that the relativistic and intrinsic asymmetry effects are of comparable importance. Intrinsic/environmental asymmetry effects are more important at high radio luminosities and small physical scales. The mean translational speed of the lobes is found to be 0.11c, consistent with the speeds found from spectral ageing arguments. According to a Gaussian model, the standard deviation of lobe speeds is 0.04c.

It is shown that large mixing governing the dominant channel of the atmospheric neutrino oscillations can be naturally obtained and that this constrained seesaw mechanism favours the normal mass hierarchy for the light neutrinos leading to a small $U_{e3}$ entry of the lepton mixing matrix and a mass scale of the lightest right handed neutrino $M\simeq 10^{10} - 10^{11}$ GeV.

Several possible zero temperature phases are consistent with the constraints. A simple picture for the phase structure emerges if these theories choose the phase, consistent with global anomaly matching, that minimizes the massless degree of freedom count defined through the free energy. This idea suggests that confinement with the preservation of the global symmetries through the formation of massless composite fermions is in general not preferred.

This generalizes the well-known directedness of the set of smooth webs and that of analytical graphs, respectively.

First a stratum is defined to be the set of all connections of one and the same gauge orbit type, i.e. the conjugacy class of the centralizer of the holonomy group. Then a slice theorem is proven on $\Ab$. This yields the openness of the strata. Afterwards, a denseness theorem is proven for the strata. Hence, $\Ab$ is topologically regularly stratified by $\Gb$. These results coincide with those of Kondracki and Rogulski for Sobolev connections. As a by-product, we prove that the set of all gauge orbit types equals the set of all (conjugacy classes of) Howe subgroups of $\LG$.

  NGC 7789","The red clump stars in the open cluster NGC 752 present a peculiar distribution in the colour-magnitude diagran (CMD): the clump is observed to present a faint extension, slightly to the blue of the main concentration of clump stars. We point out that a similar structure is present in the CMD of NGC 7789, and discuss their possible origins. This feature may be understood as the result of having, at the same time, stars of low-mass which undergo the helium-flash, and those just massive enough for avoiding it. The ages of both clusters are compatible with this interpretation. Similar features can be produced in theoretical models which assume a non-negligible mass spread for clump stars, of about 0.2 Mo. However, one can probably exclude that the observed effect is due to the natural mass range of core helium burning stars found in single isochrones, although present models do not present the level of detail necessary to completely explore this possibility. Also the possibility of a large age spread among cluster stars can be refuted on observational grounds. We then suggest a few alternatives. This spread may be resulting either from star-to-star variations in the mass-loss rates during the RGB phase. Alternatively, effects sush as stellar rotation or convective core overshooting, could be causing a significant spread in the core mass at He-ignition for star of similar mass. Finally, we point out that similar effects could also help to understand the distribution of clump stars in the CMDs of the clusters NGC 2660 and NGC 2204.",L. Girardi; J. -C. Mermilliod; G.

In this paper I show that conformally invariant scalar and Dirac fields satisfy quantum inequalities in two dimensional spacetimes with a conformal factor that depends on $x$ only or on $t$ only. These inequalities are then applied to two dimensional black hole and cosmological spacetimes. It is shown that the bound on the negative energies diverges to minus infinity as the event horizon or initial singularity is approached. Thus, neglecting back reaction, negative energies become unconstrained near the horizon or initial singularity.

  Population Parameters","We present single stellar population (SSP) equivalent ages, metallicities, and abundance ratios for local elliptical galaxies derived from Hbeta, Mgb, and <Fe> absorption line strengths. We use an extension of the Worthey (1994) stellar population models that incorporates non-solar line-strength ""response functions"" by Tripicco & Bell (1995), allowing us to correct the models for the enhancements of Mg and other alpha-like elements relative to the Fe-peak elements. SSP-equivalent ages of local ellipticals from Gonzalez (1993) are found to vary widely, 1.5 < t < 18 Gyr, while metallicities [Z/H] and enhancement ratios [E/Fe] are strongly peaked around <[Z/H]>=+0.26 and <[E/Fe]>=+0.20 (in an aperture of radius Re/8). The enhancement ratios are milder than previous estimates, owing to the application of non-solar abundance corrections to both Mgb and <Fe> for the first time. Gradients in stellar populations within galaxies are found to be mild, with SSP-equivalent age decreasing by 25%, metallicity decreasing by <[Z/H]>=0.20 dex, and [E/Fe] remaining nearly constant out to an aperture of radius Re/2 for nearly all systems. Our ages have an overall zeropoint uncertainty of at least 25% due to uncertainties in the stellar evolution prescription, the oxygen abundance, the effect of non-solar abundances on the isochrones, and other unknowns. However, the relative age rankings of stellar populations should be largely unaffected by these errors. In particular, the large spread in ages appears to be real and cannot be explained by contamination of Hbeta by blue stragglers or hot horizontal branch stars, or by fill-in of Hbeta by emission.

We show that this potential is adequate to model stellar-kinematic samples with radial extent ranging from \~100 pc to ~5 kpc in the Galaxy. The two-integral model that gives the best fit to the first three projected moments provides a very good global representation of the data but fails to reproduce the central dispersion, the central apparent scaleheight and the cylindrical rotation at intermediate longitudes. All these features are fitted well by a three--integral model. We discuss various properties of the 2I- and 3I models and the implications for galactic structure. A somewhat thicker disk component is needed to explain the distribution of older AGB stars in the plane; this component also fits the kinematics at higher latitudes better.

  Portevin - Le Chatelier effect",A characteristic feature of the Portevin - Le Chatelier effect or the jerky flow is the stick-slip nature of stress-strain curves which is believed to result from the negative strain rate dependence of the flow stress. The latter is assumed to result from the competition of a few relevant time scales controlling the dynamics of jerky flow. We address the issue of time scales and its connection to the negative strain rate sensitivity of the flow stress within the framework of a model for the jerky flow which is known to reproduce several experimentally observed features including the negative strain rate sensitivity of the flow stress. We attempt to understand the above issues by analyzing the geometry of the slow manifold underlying the relaxational oscillations in the model. We show that the nature of the relaxational oscillations is a result of the atypical bent geometry of the slow manifold. The analysis of the slow manifold structure helps us to understand the time scales operating in different regions of the slow manifold. Using this information we are able to establish connection with the strain rate sensitivity of the flow stress.

Exact self-similar solutions occur if, and only if, $Dn=2$, and for this case of $Dn=2$ we exhibit an exact but rather special D=1 analytical self-similar solution collapsing to a $\delta$-function which however recovers and collapses periodically, while the ordinary G-P equation in 2 space dimensions also has a special solution with periodic $\delta$-function collapses and revivals of the density.

Presently, there is a resurgence of interest in it, mainly for two reasons: (i) Experimental investigations are under way with ever increasing precision, be it in the laboratory or by observing outer space. (ii) One desires to test out alternatives to Einstein's gravitational theory, in particular those of a gauge-theoretical nature, like Einstein-Cartan theory or metric-affine gravity. A clean discussion requires a reflection on the foundations of electrodynamics. If one bases electrodynamics on the conservation laws of electric charge and magnetic flux, one finds Maxwell's equations expressed in terms of the excitation H=(D,H) and the field strength F=(E,B) without any intervention of the metric or the linear connection of spacetime. In other words, there is still no coupling to gravity. Only the constitutive law H= functional(F) mediates such a coupling. We discuss the different ways of how metric, nonmetricity, torsion, and curvature can come into play here. Along the way, we touch on non-local laws (Mashhoon), non-linear ones (Born-Infeld, Heisenberg-Euler, Plebanski), linear ones, including the Abelian axion (Ni), and find a method for deriving the metric from linear electrodynamics (Toupin, Schoenberg).

However, if x dependence of the sea-quark distribution is fixed at small x by ""perturbative QCD"" and Regge theory, it becomes \Delta \Sigma=0.24 ~ 0.28 in the NLO.

  properties of X-ray clusters in a low-density universe","We present results from a series of cosmological SPH (smoothed particle hydrodynamics) simulations coupled with the P3M (Particle-Particle-Particle-Mesh) solver for the gravitational force. The simulations are designed to predict the statistical properties of X-ray clusters of galaxies as well as to study the formation of galaxies. We have seven simulation runs with different assumptions on the thermal state of the intracluster gas. Following the recent work by Pearce et al., we modify our SPH algorithm so as to phenomenologically incorporate the galaxy formation by decoupling the cooled gas particles from the hot gas particles. All the simulations employ 128^3 particles both for dark matter and for gas components, and thus constitute the largest systematic catalogues of simulated clusters in the SPH method performed so far. These enable us to compare the analytical predictions on statistical properties of X-ray clusters against our direct simulation results in an unbiased manner. We find that the luminosities of the simulated clusters are quite sensitive to the thermal history and also to the numerical resolution of the simulations, and thus are not reliable. On the other hand, the mass-temperature relation for the simulated clusters is fairly insensitive to the assumptions of the thermal state of the intracluster gas, robust against the numerical resolution, and in fact agrees well with the analytic prediction. Therefore the prediction for the X-ray temperature function of clusters on the basis of the Press-Schechter mass function and the virial equilibrium is fairly reliable.",Kohji Yoshikawa; Y. P.

By ""substantially decreased"" we mean that the correlations which involve the bath's states prove negligible, while the correlations between the qubit's and the environment's states can be made ineffective during a comparatively long time interval. So, effectively, one may choose the conditions under which, for sufficiently long time interval, the initial state of ""qubit + bath"" remains unchanged, thus removing any kind of the errors.

This is supported by correlations between the spectral index, the strength of Compton reflection, and the peak frequencies in the power density spectrum, as well as by the frequency-dependence of Fourier-resolved spectra. Spectral variability may then be driven by the variable truncation radius of the disk. The soft state appears to correspond to the smallest truncation radii. However, the lack of high-energy cutoffs observed in the soft state implies that its main radiative process is Compton scattering of disk photons by non-thermal electrons.

The diagonal terms associated to the bi-orthogonality relations (which replace the notion of quadratic norm evaluations for orthogonal polynomials) are expressed in terms of residues of the complex weight function using intertwining properties of the non-symmetric Askey-Wilson transform under the action of the double affine Hecke algebra. We evaluate the constant term, which is essentially the well-known Askey-Wilson integral, using shift operators. We furthermore show how these results reduce to well-known properties of the symmetric Askey-Wilson polynomials, as were originally derived by Askey and Wilson using basic hypergeometric series theory.",Masatoshi Noumi; Jasper V.

cond-mat/0001060v1,Lyapunov exponent for pure and random Fibonacci chains,"We study the Lyapunov exponent for electron and phonon excitations, in pure and random Fibonacci quasicrystal chains, using an exact real space renormalization group method, which allows the calculation of the Lyapunov exponent as a function of the energy. It is shown that the Lyapunov exponent on a pure Fibonacci chain has a self-similar structure, characterized by a scaling index that is independent of the energy for the electron excitations, ''diagonal'' or ''off-diagonal'' quasiperiodic, but is a function of the energy for the phonon excitations. This scaling behavior implies the vanishing of the Lyapunov exponent for the states on the spectrum, and hence the absence of localization on the Fibonacci chain, for the various excitations considered. It is also shown that disordered Fibonacci chains, with random tiling that introduces phason flips at certain sites on the chain, exhibit the same Lyapunov exponent as the pure Fibonacci chain, and hence this type of disorder is irrelevant, either in the case of electron or phonon excitations.",M.

They have low to intermediate X-ray fluxes and an irregular morphology in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey (RASS). These clusters are chosen to test the abilities and limitations of the RASS in terms of cluster fluxes and cluster morphologies. Therefore some ``worst'' cases are used here. X-ray observations with the ROSAT/HRI and optical spectroscopic observations are carried out. The ROSAT/HRI observations, which have a much better spatial resolution than the RASS, reveal in two of the three cases a significantly different morphology than seen in the RASS. The reasons are point sources which could not be resolved in the RASS and were therefore confused with the cluster emission. For A3570 we could confirm the relaxed state of the cluster by the optical determination of a small velocity dispersion. In the cluster with the lowest flux (Abell 901) the countrate measurement is strongly affected by point sources, in the two other cases the countrate measurements of the RASS are reliable, i.e. they are reproduced by the ROSAT/HRI measurement. We conclude that for clusters with a flux of a few times 10^{-12} erg/cm^2/s or smaller, which show at the same time a non-relaxed morphology, the flux measurement of the RASS can be seriously affected by fore- or background sources. We point out that an all-sky survey of a second ABRIXAS mission would provide a much clearer source distinction for low-flux clusters and thus a much improved countrate determination.",Sabine Schindler,astro-ph,astro-ph

From the amplitude and timescale of the soft X-ray variability, tight limits are derived for the temporal behaviour of the white-dwarf radius and the effective temperature of its envelope. A limit-cycle model is proposed to explain the observed optical and X-ray variability, the characteristic timescales of the durations of the X-ray on and off states, and those of the transitions between both states. Our observations confirm that the radius changes of the white-dwarf envelope occur on the Kelvin-Helmholtz timescale.

The properties of the halo mass structure found are similar to that claimed for a number of dwarf and low surface brightness galaxies, but provide a more substantial evidence of the discrepancy between the halo mass distribution predicted in standard cold dark matter scenario and those actually detected around galaxies.

We derive the energy dependence of these effects near the caustics at which the flux amplification of a point source diverges. We show that the large magnification of images around caustics leads to an amplification bias, which can make them dominate the flux in some energy ranges. We argue that clustering in the arrival directions of UHECRs of comparable energy may be due to magnetic lensing around caustics. We show that magnetic lensing can also significantly alter the observed composition of cosmic rays at the highest energies.

The best-fitting models fit the cluster colors very well -- the weighted mean color offsets are all < 0.05 mag. The most significant offsets between model and data are in the U and B passbands; these are not unexpected and are likely due to problems with the spectral libraries used by the models.

Similarly to the scattering data used in the known spectral transform, in this approach the monodromy data for solution of associated linear system characterize completely any solution of the reduced Einstein equations, and many physical and geometrical properties of the solutions can be expressed directly in terms of the analytical structure on the spectral plane of the corresponding monodromy data functions. The Belinskii and Zakharov vacuum soliton generating transformations can be expressed in explicit form (without specification of the background solution) as simple (linear-fractional) transformations of the corresponding monodromy data functions with coefficients, polynomial in spectral parameter.

  Spectrum and COBE-DMR","We combine COBE-DMR measurements of cosmic microwave background anisotropy with a recent measurement of the mass power spectrum at redshift z=2.5 from Lya forest data to derive constraints on cosmological parameters and test the inflation+CDM scenario of structure formation. By treating the inflationary spectral index n as a free parameter, we can find successful fits to the COBE and Lya forest constraints in Omega_m=1 models with and without massive neutrinos and in low-Omega_m models with and without a cosmological constant. Within each class of model, the combination of COBE and the Lya forest P(k) constrains a parameter combination of the form (Omega_m h^a n^b Omega_b^c), with different indices for each case. This new constraint breaks some of the degeneracies in cosmological parameter determinations from other measurements. The Lya forest P(k) provides the first measurement of the slope of the linear mass power spectrum on ~Mpc scales, and it confirms a basic prediction of the inflationary CDM scenario: a nearly scale-invariant spectrum of primeval fluctuations (n~1) that bends towards k^{n-4} on small scales. Considering additional observational data, we find that COBE-normalized, Omega_m=1 models that match the Lya forest P(k) do not match the observed masses of rich galaxy clusters and that a low-Omega_m model with a cosmological constant provides the best overall fit, even without the direct evidence for cosmic acceleration from supernovae. Modest improvements in the Lya forest P(k) measurement could greatly restrict the allowable region of parameter space for CDM models, constrain the contribution of tensor fluctuations to CMB anisotropy, and achieve a more stringent test of the current consensus model of structure formation.",John Phillips; David H.

We present archival X-ray observations of PSR J1814-1744 made with ROSAT and ASCA. X-ray emission is not detected from the position of the radio pulsar. The derived upper flux limit implies an X-ray luminosity significantly smaller than those of all known AXPs. This conclusion is insensitive to the possibility that X-ray emission from PSR J1814-1744 is beamed or that it undergoes modest variability.

The coupling between the Pr and Mn spins may also provide a basis for understanding the low temperature phase diagram of this most unusual manganite.",M. Roy; J. F. Mitchell; A. P. Ramirez; P.

  shells - I. FH Ser, V533 Her, BT Mon, DK Lac, V476 Cyg","In this paper we report on the first five out of eleven observations in our programme of Hubble Space Telescope (HST) imaging of old nova shells. We present new WFPC2 images of the shells around FH Ser and V533 Her taken in the F656N (Halpha+[NII]) filter. We also show long-slit spectra taken using the William Herschel Telescope (WHT) in La Palma for these objects in the same spectral range. The shell around FH Ser is found to be a prolate ellipsoid of ellipticity 1.3 +/- 0.1 inclined at 62 +/- 4 deg to the line of sight. The shell has an equatorial ring which is found to be due to increased emission in the two [NII] lines rather than Halpha. The expansion velocity, systemic velocity and distance are found to be 490 +/- 20 km/s, -45 km/s and 950 +/- 50 pc. The origin of the [NII] equatorial ring is discussed in the context of a photoionization feature resulting from aspherical illumination by the central source rather than a simple density enhancement. It is possible however that the ring is also in part due to an extremely localised increase in the nitrogen abundance. Similar imaging and spectroscopy of the nova V533 Her reveal a shell of radius 5 +/- 0.7 arcsec with an axial ratio of 1.2 +/- 0.2, expansion velocity of 850 +/- 150 km/s and distance 1250 +/- 300 pc.

astro-ph/0001094v1,Photoionization of Galactic Halo Gas by Old Supernova Remnants,"We present new calculations on the contribution from cooling hot gas to the photoionization of warm ionized gas in the Galaxy. We show that hot gas in cooling supernova remnants (SNRs) is an important source of photoionization, particularly for gas in the halo. We find that in many regions at high latitude this source is adequate to account for the observed ionization so there is no need to find ways to transport stellar photons from the disk. The flux from cooling SNRs sets a floor on the ionization along any line of sight. Our model flux is also shown to be consistent with the diffuse soft X-ray background and with soft X-ray observations of external galaxies.   We consider the ionization of the clouds observed towards the halo star HD 93521, for which there are no O stars close to the line of sight. We show that the observed ionization can be explained successfully by our model EUV/soft X-ray flux from cooling hot gas. In particular, we can match the H alpha intensity, the S++/S+ ratio, and the C+* column. From observations of the ratios of columns of C+* and either S+ or H0, we are able to estimate the thermal pressure in the clouds. The slow clouds require high (~10^4 cm^-3 K) thermal pressures to match the N(C+*)/N(S+) ratio. Additional heating sources are required for the slow clouds to maintain their ~7000 K temperatures at these pressures, as found by Reynolds, Hausen & Tufte (1999).",Jonathan D. Slavin; Christopher F.

cond-mat/0001066v1,The effect of compression on the global optimization of atomic clusters,"Recently, Locatelli and Schoen proposed a transformation of the potential energy that aids the global optimization of Lennard-Jones clusters with non-icosahedral global minima. These cases are particularly difficult to optimize because the potential energy surface has a double funnel topography with the global minimum at the bottom of the narrower funnel. Here we analyse the effect of this type of transformation on the topography of the potential energy surface. The transformation, which physically corresponds to a compression of the cluster, firstly reduces the number of stationary points on the potential energy surface. Secondly, we show that for a 38-atom cluster with a face-centred-cubic global minimum the transformation causes the potential energy surface to become increasingly dominated by the funnel associated with the global minimum. The transformation has been incorporated in the basin-hopping algorithm using a two-phase approach.",Jonathan Doye,cond-mat,cond-mat; physics.atm-clus

This group and its complex analogue CC_m have arisen in recent years in connection with the construction of orthogonal spreads, Kerdock sets, packings in Grassmannian spaces, quantum codes, Siegel modular forms and spherical designs.   In this paper we give a simpler proof of Runge's 1996 result that the space of invariants for C_m of degree 2k is spanned by the complete weight enumerators of the codes obtained by tensoring binary self-dual codes of length 2k with the field GF(2^m); these are a basis if m >= k-1. We also give new constructions for L_m and C_m: let M be the Z[sqrt(2)]-lattice with Gram matrix [2, sqrt(2); sqrt(2), 2]. Then L_m is the rational part of the mth tensor power of M, and C_m is the automorphism group of this tensor power. Also, if C is a binary self-dual code not generated by vectors of weight 2, then C_m is precisely the automorphism group of the complete weight enumerator of the tensor product of C and GF(2^m).

cs/0001003v1,Why C++ is not very fit for GUI programming,"With no intent of starting a holy war, this paper lists several annoying C++ birthmarks that the author has come across developing GUI class libraries. C++'s view of classes, instances and hierarchies appears tantalizingly close to GUI concepts of controls, widgets, window classes and subwindows. OO models of C++ and of a window system are however different. C++ was designed to be a ""static"" language with a lexical name scoping, static type checking and hierarchies defined at compile time. Screen objects on the other hand are inherently dynamic; they usually live well beyond the procedure/block that created them; the hierarchy of widgets is defined to a large extent by layout, visibility and event flow. Many GUI fundamentals such as dynamic and geometric hierarchies of windows and controls, broadcasting and percolation of events are not supported directly by C++ syntax or execution semantics (or supported as ""exceptions"" -- pun intended). Therefore these features have to be emulated in C++ GUI code. This leads to duplication of a graphical toolkit or a window manager functionality, code bloat, engaging in unsafe practices and forgoing of many strong C++ features (like scoping rules and compile-time type checking). This paper enumerates a few major C++/GUI sores and illustrates them on simple examples.",Oleg Kiselyov,cs.PL,cs.PL; D.3.3; D.1.5
astro-ph/0001095v1,"Phase Lag and Coherence Function of X-ray emission from Black Hole
  Candidate XTE J1550-564","We report the results from measuring the phase lag and coherence function of X-ray emission from black hole candidate (BHC) XTE J1550-564. These X-ray temporal properties have been recognized to be increasingly important in providing important diagnostics of the dynamics of accretion flows around black holes. For XTE J1550-564, we found significant hard lag --- the X-ray variability in high energy bands {\em lags} behind that in low energy bands --- associated both with broad-band variability and quasi-periodic oscillation (QPO). However, the situation is more complicated for the QPO: while hard lag was measured for the first harmonic of the signal, the fundamental component showed significant {\em soft} lag. Such behavior is remarkably similar to what was observed of microquasar GRS 1915+105. The phase lag evolved during the initial rising phase of the 1998 outburst. The magnitude of both the soft and hard lags of the QPO increases with X-ray flux, while the Fourier spectrum of the broad-band lag varies significantly in shape. The coherence function is relatively high and roughly constant at low frequencies, and begins to drop almost right after the first harmonic of the QPO. It is near unity at the beginning and decreases rapidly during the rising phase. Also observed is that the more widely separated the two energy bands are the less the coherence function between the two. It is interesting that the coherence function increases significantly at the frequencies of the QPO and its harmonics. We discuss the implications of the results on the models proposed for BHCs.",Wei Cui; Shuang Nan Zhang; Wan Chen,astro-ph,astro-ph
nlin/0001001v4,"Fermionic representation for basic hypergeometric functions related to
  Schur polynomials","We present the fermionic representation for the q-deformed hypergeometric functions related to Schur polynomials considered by S.Milne \cite{Milne}. For $q=1$ these functions are also known as hypergeometric functions of matrix argument which are related to zonal spherical polynomials for $GL(N,C)/U(N)$ symmetric space. We show that these multivariable hypergeometric functions are tau-functions of the KP hierarchy. At the same time they are the ratios of Toda lattice tau-functions considered by Takasaki in \cite{Tinit}, \cite{T} evaluated at certain values of higher Toda lattice times. The variables of the hypergeometric functions are related to the higher times of those hierarchies via Miwa change of variables. The discrete Toda lattice variable shifts parameters of hypergeometric functions. Hypergeometric functions of type ${}_pF_s$ can be also viewed as group 2-cocycle for the $\Psi$DO on the circle of the order $p-s \leq 1$ (the group times are higher times of TL hierarchy and the arguments of hypergeometric function). We get the determinant representation and the integral representation of special type of KP tau-functions, these results generalize some of Milne's results in \cite{Milne}. We write down a system of linear differential and difference equations for these tau-functions (string equations).

astro-ph/0001096v1,"Mapping the Evolution of High Redshift Dusty Galaxies with Submillimeter
  Observations of a Radio-Selected Sample","Direct submm imaging has recently revealed the 850-micron background to be mostly composed of a population of distant ultraluminous infrared galaxies, but identifying the optical/NIR counterparts to these sources has proved difficult due to the poor submm spatial resolution. However, the proportionality of both cm and submm data to the star formation rate suggests that high resolution radio continuum maps with subarcsecond positional accuracy can be exploited to locate submm sources. In this paper we present results from a targeted SCUBA survey of micro-Jansky radio sources in the flanking fields of the Hubble Deep Field. Even with relatively shallow 850-micron SCUBA observations (>6 mJy at 3-sigma), we were successful at making submm detections of optical/NIR-faint (I>24 and K~21-22) radio sources, and our counts closely match the bright counts from submm surveys. Redshift estimates can be made from the ratio of the submm flux to the radio flux across the 100 GHz break in the spectral energy distribution. This millimetric redshift estimation places the bright submm population at z=1-3 where it forms the high redshift tail of the faint radio population. The star formation rate density (SFRD) due to ultraluminous infrared galaxies increases by more than two orders of magnitude from z~0 to z~1-3.

astro-ph/0001099v1,"Biased Estimates of Omega from Comparing Smoothed Predicted Velocity
  Fields to Unsmoothed Peculiar Velocity Measurements","We show that a regression of unsmoothed peculiar velocity measurements against peculiar velocities predicted from a smoothed galaxy density field leads to a biased estimate of the cosmological density parameter Omega, even when galaxies trace the underlying mass distribution and galaxy positions and velocities are known perfectly. The bias arises because the errors in the predicted velocities are correlated with the predicted velocities themselves. We investigate this bias using cosmological N-body simulations and analytic arguments. In linear perturbation theory, for cold dark matter power spectra and Gaussian or top hat smoothing filters, the bias in Omega is always positive, and its magnitude increases with increasing smoothing scale. This linear calculation reproduces the N-body results for Gaussian smoothing radii R_s > 10 Mpc/h, while non-linear effects lower the bias on smaller smoothing scales, and for R_s < 3 Mpc/h Omega is underestimated rather than overestimated. The net bias in Omega for a given smoothing filter depends on the underlying cosmological model. The effect on current estimates of Omega from velocity-velocity comparisons is probably small relative to other uncertainties, but taking full advantage of the statistical precision of future peculiar velocity data sets will require either equal smoothing of the predicted and measured velocity fields or careful accounting for the biases discussed here.",Andreas A.

We consider a random pump mechanism which allows the presence of at most one pair of atoms in the cavity at any time. We analyze the differences between the present system, called the Dicke micromaser, and an equivalently pumped conventional one-atom micromaser. These differences are attributed to the Dicke cooperativity in the two-atom system. We also show that the two-atom Dicke micromaser is equivalent to a one-atom cascade two-photon micromaser. With the introduction of a one-photon detuning, the present theory further describes a true two-photon micromaser. We discuss in detail the role of one-photon detuning in the mechanism of a one-atom two-photon micromaser.

Then we define a space S, the space of all spaces equipped with the spectral distance. We argue that this space S can be regarded as a metric space and that it also possess other desirable properties. These facts make the space S a suitable arena for spacetime physics.   We apply the spectral framework to the averaging problem:   We sketch the model-fitting procedure in terms of the spectral representation, and also discuss briefly how to analyze the dynamical aspects of the averaging procedure with this scheme.   In these analyses, we are naturally led to the concept of the apparatus- and the scale-dependent effective evolution of the universe.

For p=1, the values in both Euclidean and Manhattan metric are 1, and as p tends to zero, the values are 0.72 and 0.92 in the Euclidean and Manhattan metrics respectively.The problem is trivial for p=1 but it reduces to the continuum TSP as p tends to zero.

The hk method has distinct advantages over Delta-S and other techniques in determining the metallicity of RR Lyrae stars, and has allowed us to obtain the most complete and homogeneous metallicity data to date for the RR Lyrae stars in this cluster. For RR Lyrae stars in common with the Delta-S observations of Butler et al. (1978) and Gratton et al. (1986), we have found that our metallicities, [Fe/H](hk), deviate systematically from their Delta-S metallicity, while our [Fe/H](hk) for well observed field RRab stars are consistent with previous spectroscopic measurements. We conclude that this is due to the larger errors associated with the previous Delta-S observations for this cluster. The Mv(RR) - [Fe/H] and period-shift - [Fe/H] relations obtained from our new data are consistent with the evolutionary models predicted by Lee (1991), confirming that the luminosity of RR Lyrae stars depends on evolutionary status as well as metallicity.

astro-ph/0001102v1,RR Lyrae Variables in the Globular Cluster M5,"We present V-band CCD photometry of 65 RR Lyr variables from the globular cluster M5. We have estimated the basic physical parameters for 16 RRc stars and 26 RRab stars using a Fourier decomposition of the light curves of the variables. The mean values of mass, luminosity, effective temperature and relative helium abundance for the RRc stars are measured to be ${\cal M}=0.54{\cal M}_\odot$, log L = 1.69 T_{eff}=7353 K and Y=0.28, respectively. For the RRab variables the derived mean values of absolute magnitude, metallicity and effective temperature are: M_V=0.81, [Fe/H]=-1.23 and T_{eff}=6465 K. We find that the V amplitude of an RRab star for a given period is a function of metal abundance rather than Oosterhoff type. We find significant problems with the calibration of both the zero point and the scale of the luminosities measured with the Fourier technique. The apparent distance modulus derived from RRc stars is equal to $14.47\pm0.11$ and it is in good agreement with recent determinations. On the other hand distance modulus obtained from the sample of RRab stars (calibrated by the Baade-Wesselink observations of field RR Lyr variables) is significantly smaller and equal to $14.27\pm0.04$",J.

It provides a simple description for high momentum degrees of freedom. It also shows that the low momentum modes can be well approximated by ordinary local fields. Long range interactions are generated in the effective action for the lower momentum modes after integrating out the high momentum bi-local fields. The low momentum modes can be represented by diagonal blocks in the matrix model picture and the high momentum bi-local fields correspond to off-diagonal blocks.

For each observation, we produced light curves and color-color diagrams. We classified the observations in 12 separate classes, based on their count rate and color characteristics. From the analysis of these classes, we reduced the variability of the source to transitions between three basic states: a hard state corresponding to the non-observability of the innermost parts of the accretion disk, and two softer states with a fully observable disk. These two soft states represent different temperatures of the accretion disk, related to different local values of the accretion rate. The transitions between these states can be extremely fast. The source moves between these three states following certain patterns and avoiding others, giving rise to a relatively large but limited number of variability classes. These results are the first step towards a linking of the properties of this exceptional source with standard black-hole systems and with accretion disk models.",T. Belloni; M. Klein-Wolt; M.

astro-ph/0001105v1,Clustering of galaxies at faint magnitudes,"Significant uncertainties exist in the measured amplitude of the angular two-point correlation function of galaxies at magnitudes $I\approx26$ and fainter. Published results from HST and ground-based galaxy catalogs seem to differ by as much as a factor of 3, and it is not clear whether the correlation amplitude as a function of magnitude increases or decreases in the faintest magnitude bins. In order to clarify the situation, we present new results from both ground-based and HST galaxy catalogs. The angular two-point correlation function as a function of limiting R and I magnitudes was computed from a galaxy catalog created from the Hubble Deep Field - South (HDF-S) WFPC2 image. The measured amplitudes of the correlation at an angular separation of 1 arcsec are consistent with those measured in the Northern counter part of the field. The flanking fields (FF fields) of the Hubble deep fields were used to extend the magnitude range for which we compute correlation amplitudes towards brighter magnitude bins. This allows easier comparison of the amplitudes to ground based data. The newly measured correlation amplitudes as a function of magnitude limit were compared to previously published measurements at larger separations. For this comparison, the correlation function was approximated by a power law with an index of 0.8. The scatter in the correlation amplitudes is too large to be explained by random errors. We argue that the most likely cause is the assumption that the shape of the correlation function does not depend on the magnitude limit.",J. U. Fynbo; W. Freudling; P. Moller,astro-ph,astro-ph

In addition, several examples of absorbing-state transitions which do not belong to the directed percolation universality class will be discussed.

The population of flat-spectrum radio sources with micro-Jy flux-densities detected with the Square-Kilometer-Array is expected to have dimensions of micro-arcsec. They will therefore vary rapidly as a result of Galactic scintillation (diffractive and refractive). However, when positioned behind distant galaxies they will also show variations due to microlensing, even more strongly than in the case of B1600+434. Relativistic or superluminal motion in these background sources typically leads to temporal variations on time scales of days to weeks. Scintillation and microlensing can be distinguished, and separated, by their different characteristic time scales and the frequency dependence of their modulations. Monitoring studies with Square-Kilometer-Array at GHz frequencies will thus probe both microscopic and macroscopic properties of dark matter and its mass-function as a function of redshift, information very hard to obtain by any other method.",L.

  AGN","We report the transition to an active state of the nucleus in the Seyfert 1.9 galaxy NGC 2992, discovered by means of new hard X-ray data. While the 2-10 keV flux declined by a factor of ~ 20 from 1978 to 1994, two recent BeppoSAX observations in 1997 and in 1998 caught the nuclear emission raising back to the same level of activity observed in 1978.   In both BeppoSAX observations the X-ray spectrum of the source is well represented by a power law with spectral index Gamma ~ 1.7, absorbed by a column density of N_H ~ 10^{22} cm^{-2} and characterized by a prominent iron K\alpha line. While in the second BeppoSAX data set the line properties appear to be consistent with those expected from accretion disc models, in the first BeppoSAX data set the iron feature is rather peculiar. The broadening is not significant and the line energy is E_{K\alpha}=6.62 +/- 0.07 keV, indicating emission from highly ionized iron. The line has too high equivalent width (~ 700 eV) to be produced by a hot scattering medium. By comparing these data with data previously in the literature, we interpret the spectral and flux changes in terms of different phases of rebuilding an accretion disc. The timescale for the disc rebuilding is estimated to range between 1 and 5 years.   The X-ray data are complemented with optical and near-infrared followup spectra taken 1.5 months after the discovery of the X-ray burst. The spectra are characterized by prominent broad emission lines. There is also evidence for hot dust emission in the H and K bands that, however, is probably still in the process of increasing.",R.

nucl-ex/0001003v1,Magnetic Trapping of Neutrons,"Accurate measurement of the lifetime of the neutron (which is unstable to beta decay) is important for understanding the weak nuclear force and the creation of matter during the Big Bang. Previous measurements of the neutron lifetime have mainly been limited by certain systematic errors; however, these could in principle be avoided by performing measurements on neutrons stored in a magnetic trap. Neutral and charged particle traps are widely used tool for studying both composite and elementary particles, because they allow long interaction times and isolation from perturbing environments. Here we report the magnetic trapping of neutrons. The trapping region is filled with superfluid 4-He, which is used to load neutrons into the trap and as a scintillator to detect their decay. Neutrons have a lifetime in the trap of 750 +330/-200 seconds, mainly limited by their beta decay rather than trap losses. Our experiment verifies theoretical predictions regarding the loading process and magnetic trapping of neutrons.

To this aim the collective dynamics of the nucleus-nucleus collision is described within a transport model of the coupled channel RBUU type. There are two factors which dominantly determine the baryon flow at these energies: the momentum dependence of the scalar ($U_S$) and vector potentials ($U_\mu$) for baryons and the resonance/string degrees of freedom for energetic hadron excitations. We fix the explicit momentum dependence of the nucleon-meson couplings by the nucleon optical potential up to 1 GeV and extrapolate to higher energy. When assuming the optical potential to vanish identically for $E_{kin} \geq 3.5$ GeV we simultaneously describe the sideward flow data of the PLASTIC BALL, FOPI, EoS and E877 collaborations, the elliptic flow data of the E895 and E877 collaborations and approximately the rapidity and transverse mass distribution of protons at AGS energies without employing any {\it explicit} assumption on a phase transition in the EoS.

The Wide Field Cameras and the Narrow Field Instruments (NFI) on board BeppoSAX observed SAX J1819.3-2525 at various stages of its activity before that, in the spring and fall of 1999. The fluxes range between 0.012 and 0.3 Crab units (2-10 keV). The NFI observation is unique because it is the longest semi-continuous observation of SAX J1819.3-2525 so far, and it offers a study of the spectrum at a relatively high resolution of 8% full width at half maximum at 6 keV. We discuss the observations with emphasis on the X-ray spectrum. A strong Fe-K emission line was detected in SAX J1819.3-2525 with an equivalent width between 0.3 and 1 keV. The line energy is up to 6.85 +/- 0.02 keV and suggests the presence of highly ionized iron. We identify this as fluorescent emission from a photo-ionized plasma. The continuum spectrum is typical for a low-mass X-ray binary in which emission from an accretion disk corona plays an important role.

  ratio at redshift z > 2","Relative elemental abundances, and in particular the alpha/Fe ratio, are an important diagnostic tool of the chemical evolution of damped Ly alpha systems (DLAs). The S/Zn ratio is not affected by differential dust depletion and is an excellent estimator of the alpha/Fe ratio. We report 6 new determinations of sulphur abundance in DLAs at zabs greater than or equal to 2 with already known zinc abundances. The combination with extant data from the literature provides a measure of the S/Zn abundance ratio for a total of 11 high redshift DLA systems. The observed [S/Zn] ratios do not show the characteristic [alpha/Fe] enhancement observed in metal-poor stars of the Milky Way at comparable level of metallicity ([Zn/H] ~ -1). The behaviour of DLAs data is consistent with a general trend of decreasing [S/Zn] ratio with increasing metallicity [Zn/H]. This would be the first evidence of the expected decrease of the alpha/Fe ratio in the course of chemical evolution of DLA systems. However, in contrast to what observed in our Galaxy, the alpha/iron-peak ratio seems to attain solar values when the metallicity is still low ([Zn/H] < -1) and to decrease below solar values at higher metallicities. The behaviour of the alpha/Fe ratio challenges the frequently adopted hypothesis that high redshift DLAs are progenitors of spiral galaxies and favours instead an origin in galaxies characterized by low star formation rates, in agreement with the results from imaging studies of low redshift DLAs, where the candidate DLA galaxies show a variety of morphological types including dwarfs and LSBs and only a minority of spirals.",Miriam Centurion; Piercarlo Bonifacio; Paolo Molaro; Giovanni Vladilo,astro-ph,astro-ph

Results from a complimentary program of JHK photometry obtained at the South African Astronomical Observatory are also presented. Dwarf carbon stars are believed to have anomalous near-infrared colours, and this feature is used for further investigation of the nature of the APM carbon stars. Our results support the use of JHK photomtery as a dwarf/giant discriminator and also reinforce the conclusion that none of the new APM-selected carbon stars are dwarfs.

Starting from the slave-boson representation with fields for occupied and unoccupied sites, an effective field theory is derived in which a complex field corresponds with the order parameter of the condensate and a real field with the total density of bosons. Near the boundary between the normal and the superfluid phase we obtain the Ginzburg-Landau functional for the superfluid order parameter.

Our calculations yield the moment generating function, allowing a straightforward derivation of the skewness of the PDF to second order. We find a new dependency on the initial perturbation spectrum.

A stripe is modeled as a partially doped domain wall in an antiferromagnet (AF), introduced in the context of two different models: the t-J model with strong Ising anisotropy, and the Hubbard model in the Hartree-Fock approximation. The domain walls with a given linear charge density are supported artificially by boundary conditions. In both models we find a regime of parameters where doped holes lose their spin and become holons (charge Q=1, spin S_z=0), which can move along the stripe without frustrating AF environment. One aspect in which the holons on the AF domain wall differ from those in an ordinary one-dimensional electron gas is their transverse degree of freedom: a mobile holon always resides on a transverse kink (or antikink) of the domain wall. This gives rise to two holon flavors and to a strong coupling between doped charges and transverse fluctuations of a stripe.",Oleg Tchernyshyov; Leonid P. Pryadko,cond-mat.str-el,cond-mat.str-el
cond-mat/0001076v2,Theoretical Investigation of Water Formation on Rh and Pt Surfaces,"In this report we present a theoretical investigation of the potential-energy diagram for water formation from adsorbed O and H species on Rh(111) and Pt(111) surfaces. The study is based on accurate first-principles calculations applying density-functional theory. Our results are compared to the potential-energy diagram for this reaction inferred from experimental data by Hickman and Schmidt The calculations essentially reproduce the scheme of Hickman and Schmidt for water formation on Rh(111) with the important difference that the OH molecule is significantly more stable than assumed by Hickman and Schmidt. On Pt(111) surfaces, however, the calculations predict a barrier to OH formation very similar to that found on Rh(111). In particular, the calculated barrier to OH formation of about 20 kcal/mol seems to contradict the small 2.5 kcal/mol barrier assumed in the Hickman-Schmidt scheme and the observed large rate of water formation on Pt. A possible explanation for the apparent discrepancy between the large calculated barrier for OH formation on Pt and the experimentally observed rapid formation of water even at low temperatures is that the active sites for water formation on Pt are at ""defect"" sites and not on the ideally flat terraces. A similar conclusion has been reached by Verheij and Comsa, who did detailed experimental work on water formation on Pt surfaces. Analyzing our results, we develop an explicit picture of the interaction processes governing the formation of OH groups. This picture rationalizes the calculated weak dependence of OH formation on substrate material. An important conclusion from this work is that good catalysts for the partial oxidation of hydrocarbons should resist defect formation at their surfaces.",Steffen Wilke; Vincent Natoli; Morrel H.

In our picture the ADAF fills the central cavity evacuated by the SSD and extends beyond the transition radius into a coronal region. We find that, because of global angular momentum conservation, a significant fraction of the hot gas flows away from the black hole forming a transsonic wind, unless the injection rate depends only weakly on radius (if $r^2\dot\sigma\propto r^{-\xi}$, $\xi< 1/2$). The Bernoulli number of the inflowing gas is negative if the transition radius is $\lesssim 100$ Schwarzschild radii, so matter falling into the hole is gravitationally bound. The ratio of inflowing to outflowing mass is $\approx 1/2$, so in these solutions the accretion rate is of the same order as in standard ADAFs and much larger than in advection-dominated inflow/outflow models (ADIOS). The possible relevance of evaporation-fed solutions to accretion flows in black hole X-ray binaries is briefly discussed.",R. Turolla; C. P. Dullemond,astro-ph,astro-ph

In this generalization, the conformal symmetry is replaced by a particular kind of conformal submersion with one dimensional fibres. Special cases are studied in which the conformal submersion is holomorphic, affine, or projective. All scalar-flat Kahler metrics with such a holomorphic conformal submersion, and all four dimensional hypercomplex structures with a compatible Einstein metric, are obtained from solutions of the resulting ``affine monopole equations''. The ``projective monopole equations'' encompass Hitchin's twistorial construction of selfdual Einstein metrics from three dimensional Einstein-Weyl spaces, and lead to an explicit formula for carrying out this construction directly. Examples include new selfdual Einstein metrics depending explicitly on an arbitrary holomorphic function of one variable or an arbitrary axially symmetric harmonic function.

Deep X-ray surveys with Chandra and XMM will soon test this hypothesis. Similarly, recent sub-mm surveys with SCUBA have revealed an analogous population of exceptionally luminous, dust-enshrouded {\em star-forming} galaxies at high redshift. There is now growing evidence for an intimate link between these obscured populations. There are currently large uncertainties in the models, but several independent arguments lead to the conclusion that a significant fraction of the SCUBA sources ($10-30% $) will contain quasars. Recent observational studies of SCUBA survey sources appear to confirm these predictions, although the relative roles of AGN and star-forming activity in heating the dust are unclear. Forthcoming surveys combining X-ray and sub-mm observations will provide a very powerful tool for disentangling these processes.",O. Almaini,astro-ph,astro-ph

If $N=d_{1}\times d_{2}\times...\times d_{b}$ and $H^{[ N]}=\bigotimes H^{% [ d_{k}]}$, we give a sufficient condition for separability of a density matrix $\rho $ relative to the $H^{[ d_{k}]}$ in terms of the $L_{1}$ norm of the spin coefficients of $\rho >.$ Since the spin representation depends on the form of the tensor product, the theory applies to both full and partial separability on a given space $H^{[ N]}$% . It follows from this result that for a prescribed form of separability, there is always a neighborhood of the normalized identity in which every density matrix is separable. We also show that for every prime $p$ and $n>1$ the generalized Werner density matrix $W^{[ p^{n}]}(s) $ is fully separable if and only if $s\leq (1+p^{n-1}) ^{-1}$.",Arthur O. Pittenger; Morton H.

We use complete subsamples, drawn from the ROSAT Deep Cluster Survey (RDCS), to quantify the statistical significance of the XLF evolution out to z ~1. A consistent observational picture emerges in which the bulk of the cluster population shows no significant evolution out to z ~1, whereas the most luminous systems (L_x >~ L* [0.5-2 keV] =~ 5x10^44 erg/s) were indeed rarer, at least at z >0.5, in keeping with the original findings of the EMSS.

  order statistics","We use moving mesh hydrodynamical simulations to make maps of Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect. We present these maps for several cosmological models and explore their lowest moments. We find that the first moment, the mean Compton $y$ parameter, is typically between $1-2\times 10^{-6}$ for cluster abundance normalized models, the lower value corresponding to the high density models, and scales as $\sigma_8^{3-4}$. Rms fluctuations at 10' scale have an amplitude $ \Delta T/T \sim 1-3 \times 10^{-6}$ in the Rayleigh-Jeans regime. The amplitude of the power spectrum strongly depends on the power spectrum normalization and scales as $\sigma_8^{6-9}$. On smaller scales ($l>1000$) the spectrum is dominated by halos below $10^{13}M_{\sun}$ and so is sensitive to the thermal history of galactic halo gas. On larger scales ($l<1000$) the power spectrum is less sensitive to nongravitational energy injection, but becomes very noisy, with large field to field variations in the power spectrum caused by rare bright sources in the maps, which dominate in the spectrum over the large scale structure correlations. Cross-correlation power spectrum with weak lensing or projected galaxy distribution is significant and the cross-correlation coefficient is around 0.5 over a wide range of scales. Comparison with Press-Schechter predictions gives very good agreement for all the statistics, indicating that there is no significant contribution to SZ from non-virialized structures.

  Bursts","We use the BD2 sample of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) based on 5.9 years of BATSE DISCLA data with a variety of models of the luminosity function to derive characteristic GRB luminosities, space densities and redshift distributions. Previously published results for an open universe and modest density evolution of the GRBs showed characteristic peak luminosities around 5x10**51 erg/s in the 50-300 keV band if the emission is isotropic, and local space densities around 0.2 Gpc**-3 yr**-1. In this paper, we illustrate for several luminosity function models the predicted distributions of peak flux, luminosity and redshifts. We use the luminosity function models also to address the connection between supernovae and GRB. If all supernovae of Type Ib/c harbor a GRB, the beaming fraction would have to be 10**-5 - 10**-3.5.

These generalizations include three-branes in higher dimensional spaces which are not necessarily Anti-de Sitter far from the branes, intersecting brane configurations and configurations involving negative tension branes. We show that under certain mild assumptions there is a universal equation for the gravitational fluctuations. We study both the graviton ground state and the continuum of Kaluza-Klein modes and we find that the four-dimensional gravitational mode is localized precisely when the effects of the continuum modes decouple at distances larger than the fundamental Planck scale. The decoupling is contingent only on the long-range behaviour of the metric from the brane and we find a universal form for the corrections to Newton's Law. We also comment on the possible contribution of resonant modes. Given this, we find general classes of metrics which maintain localized four-dimensional gravity. We find that three-brane metrics in five dimensions can arise from a single scalar field source, and we rederive the BPS type conditions without any a priori assumptions regarding the form of the scalar potential.

It is shown, through an application of the heavy quark limit, the flavor SU(3) symmetry, and PCAC, that the Delta I = 1/2 rule should hold very well in these decays, and also that the Xi_b decays are purely S wave in the symmetry limit, while the difference between the $S$ wave amplitudes of the Xi_c decays and those for the Xi_b is related, in terms of the heavy quark expansion, to the difference of the total decay rates within the (Xi_c, Lambda_c) triplet of charmed hyperons.

  Dependent Dielectric to Vacuum Interface","The form of the vacuum stress-tensor for the quantized scalar field at a dielectric to vacuum interface is studied. The dielectric is modeled to have an index of refraction that varies with frequency. We find that the stress-tensor components, derived from the mode function expansion of the Wightman function, are naturally regularized by the reflection and transmission coefficients of the mode at the boundary. Additionally, the divergence of the vacuum energy associated with a perfectly reflecting mirror is found to disappear for the dielectric mirror at the expense of introducing a new energy density near the surface which has the opposite sign. Thus the weak energy condition is always violated in some region of the spacetime. For the dielectric mirror, the mean vacuum energy density per unit plate area in a constant time hypersurface is always found to be positive (or zero) and the averaged weak energy condition is proven to hold for all observers with non-zero velocity along the normal direction to the boundary. Both results are found to be generic features of the vacuum stress-tensor and not necessarily dependent of the frequency dependence of the dielectric.",Michael John Pfenning,hep-th,hep-th; gr-qc

hep-ph/0001058v2,Baryon number non-conservation and phase transitions at preheating,"Certain inflation models undergo pre-heating, in which inflaton oscillations can drive parametric resonance instabilities. We discuss several phenomena stemming from such instabilities, especially in weak-scale models; generically, these involve energizing a resonant system so that it can evade tunneling by crossing barriers classically. One possibility is a spontaneous change of phase from a lower-energy vacuum state to one of higher energy, as exemplified by an asymmetric double-well potential with different masses in each well. If the lower well is in resonance with oscillations of the potential, a system can be driven resonantly to the upper well and stay there (except for tunneling) if the upper well is not resonant. Another example occurs in hybrid inflation models where the Higgs field is resonant; the Higgs oscillations can be transferred to electroweak (EW) gauge potentials, leading to rapid transitions over sphaleron barriers and consequent B+L violation. Given an appropriate CP-violating seed, we find that preheating can drive a time-varying condensate of Chern-Simons number over large spatial scales; this condensate evolves by oscillation as well as decay into modes with shorter spatial gradients, eventually ending up as a condensate of sphalerons. We study these examples numerically and to some extent analytically.

For 3/4 of the clusters, successful spectral fits were obtained with absorption due only to the Galaxy, and therefore no extra absorption is needed within the clusters, in disagreement with the results from the Einstein SSS data for some of the same clusters. For 1/4 of the clusters, none of our spectral fits was acceptable, suggesting a more complicated cluster medium than the two-temperature and cooling flow models considered here.

Instead, Taurus seems to have formed stars in a manner qualitatively consistent with the rapid cloud formation and dispersal inferred for other, higher-density star-forming regions. I suggest that the Taurus clouds were formed rapidly by the collision of atomic gas streams in the interstellar medium, and that star formation ensued immediately afterward.",Lee Hartmann,astro-ph,astro-ph
cond-mat/0001080v2,Theory of the spin bath,"The quantum dynamics of mesoscopic or macroscopic systems is always complicated by their coupling to many ""environmental"" modes.At low T these environmental effects are dominated by localised modes, such as nuclear and paramagnetic spins, and defects (which also dominate the entropy and specific heat). This environment, at low energies, maps onto a ""spin bath"" model. This contrasts with ""oscillator bath"" models (originated by Feynman and Vernon) which describe {\it delocalised} environmental modes such as electrons, phonons, photons, magnons, etc. One cannot in general map a spin bath to an oscillator bath (or vice-versa); they constitute distinct ""universality classes"" of quantum environment. We show how the mapping to spin bath models is made, and then discuss several examples in detail, including moving particles, magnetic solitons, nanomagnets, and SQUIDs, coupled to nuclear and paramagnetic spin environments. We show how to average over spin bath modes, using an operator instanton technique, to find the system dynamics, and give analytic results for the correlation functions, under various conditions. We then describe the application of this theory to magnetic and superconducting systems.Particular attention is given to recent work on tunneling magnetic macromolecules, where the role of the nuclear spin bath in controlling the tunneling is very clear; we also discuss other magnetic systems in the quantum regime, and the influence of nuclear and paramagnetic spins on flux dynamics in SQUIDs.",Nikolay Prokof'ev; Philip Stamp,cond-mat,cond-mat

Impurity satellites due to specific U near-neighbor configurations to ^{27}Al sites are clearly resolved in both random and field-aligned powder samples. The spatial mean Kbar and rms spread delta K of impurity satellite shifts, which are related to the mean chibar and rms spread delta chi of the inhomogeneous susceptibility, have been measured in field-aligned powders with the crystalline c axis both perpendicular and parallel to the external field. The relatively narrow lines observed at low temperatures suggest that disorder- induced inhomogeneity of the f-ion--conduction-electron hybridization is not the cause of NFL behavior in these alloys: at low temperatures the experimental values of delta chi(T)/chibar(T) are much smaller than required by disorder- driven models. This is in contrast to results in at least some alloys with disordered non-f-ion nearest neighbors to f ions (""ligand disorder""), where disorder-driven theories give good accounts of NFL behavior. Our results suggest that f-ion dilution does not produce as much inhomogeneity of the hybridization strength as substitution on ligand sites.",Chia-Ying Liu; D. E. MacLaughlin; H. G. Lukefahr; G.

The solutions of the Gross-Pitaevskii (GP) and Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) equations for the condensate and low-lying quasiparticle excitations are calculated self-consistently using the discrete variable representation, while the most high-lying states are obtained with a local density approximation. Consistency of the theory for temperatures through the Bose condensation point requires that the thermodynamic chemical potential differ from the eigenvalue of the GP equation; the appropriate modifications lead to results that are continuous as a function of the particle interactions. The HFB equations are made gapless either by invoking the Popov approximation or by renormalizing the particle interactions. The latter approach effectively reduces the strength of the effective scattering length, increases the number of condensate atoms at each temperature, and raises the value of the transition temperature relative to the Popov approximation. The renormalization effect increases approximately with the log of the atom number, and is most pronounced at temperatures near the transition. Comparisons with the results of quantum Monte Carlo calculations and various local density approximations are presented, and experimental consequences are discussed.",T. Bergeman; D. L. Feder; N. L.

We find that the flavor U(n_{f}) symmetry in SU(n_{c}) theories is dynamically broken to $U(r)\times U(n_{f}-r)$ groups for $n_f \leq n_c$. In the r=1 case the dynamical symmetry breaking is caused by the condensation of monopoles in the $\underline{n_{f}}$ representation. For general r, however, the monopoles in the $\underline{{}_{n_{f}}C_{r}}$ representation, whose condensation could explain the flavor symmetry breaking but would produce too-many Nambu--Goldstone multiplets, actually ``break up'' into ``magnetic quarks'' which condense and induce confinement and the symmetry breaking. In USp(2n_c) theories with $n_f \leq n_c + 1$, the flavor SO(2n_f) symmetry is dynamically broken to U(n_f), but with no description in terms of a weakly coupled local field theory. In both SU(n_c) and USp(2 n_c) theories, with larger numbers of quark flavors, besides the vacua with these properties, there exist also vacua with no flavor symmetry breaking.",Giuseppe Carlino; Kenichi Konishi; Hitoshi Murayama,hep-th,hep-th; hep-ph

  Redshift","This paper examines what can be learned about high-redshift star formation from the small fraction of high-redshift galaxies' luminosities that is emitted at accessible wavelengths. We review and quantify empirical correlations between bolometric luminosities produced by star formation and the UV, mid-IR, sub-mm, and radio luminosities of galaxies in the local universe. These correlations suggest that observations of high-redshift galaxies at any of these wavelengths should constrain their star-formation rates to within 0.2--0.3 dex. We assemble the limited evidence that high-redshift galaxies obey these locally calibrated correlations. The characteristic luminosities and dust obscurations of galaxies at z ~ 0, z ~ 1, and z ~ 3 are reviewed. After discussing the relationship between the high-redshift populations selected in surveys at different wavelengths, we calculate the contribution to the 850um background from each. The available data show that a correlation between star-formation rate and dust obscuration L_dust/L_UV exists at low and high redshift. This correlation plays a central role in the major conclusion of this paper: most star formation at high redshift occurred in galaxies with 1 < L_dust/L_UV < 100 similar to those that host the majority of star formation in the local universe and to those that are detected in UV-selected surveys.

The obtained results are in good agreement with previous theoretical studies and experimental observations. The Young's modulus and the effective wall thickness of SWNT are obtained from the bending strain energies of SWNTs with various cross-sectional radii. The repulsion potential between ions contributes the main part of the Young's modulus of SWNT.   The wall thickness of SWNT comes completely from the overlap of electronic orbits, and is approximately of the extension of   $\pi$ orbit of carbon atom. Both the Young's modulus and the wall thickness are independent of the radius and the helicity of SWNT, and insensitive to the fitting parameters.

In the present paper we construct a two-dimensional counterexample. This together with the previous result of Yu.S.Ilyashenko (Lemma 1) implies existence of a counterexample given by a foliation on affine (projective) algebraic surface by level curves of a rational function with singularities deleted.

  medium with a massive warm component","Various independent ways of constraining the Hubble constant and the baryonic content of the universe finally converged at a consensus range of values which indicates that at the present epoch the bulk of the universe's baryons is in the form of a warm $\sim$ 10$^6$ K gas - a temperature regime which renders them difficult to detect. The discovery of EUV and soft X-ray excess emission from clusters of galaxies was originally interpreted as the first direct evidence for the large scale presence of such a warm component. We present results from an EUVE Deep Survey (DS) observation of the rich cluster Abell 2199 in the Lex/B (69 - 190 eV) filter passband. The soft excess radial trend (SERT), shown by a plot against cluster radius $r$ of the percentage EUV emission $\eta$ observed above the level expected from the hot intracluster medium (ICM), reveals that $\eta$ is a simple function of $r$ which decreases monotonically towards $r = 0$; it smoothly turns negative at $r \sim$ 6 arcmin, inwards of this radius the EUV is absorbed by cold matter with a line-of-sight column density of $\geq$ 2.7 $\times$ 10$^{19}$ cm$^{-2}$. The area of absorption is much larger than that of the cooling flow. These facts together provide strong evidence for a centrally concentrated but cluster-wide distribution of clumps of cold gas which co-exist with warm gas of similar spatial properties. Further, the simultaneous modeling of EUV and X-ray data requires a warm component even within the region of absorption. The phenomenon demonstrates a three phase ICM, with the warm phase estimated to be $\sim$ 5-10 times more massive than the hot.",Richard Lieu; Massimiliano Bonamente; Jonathan P. D.

astro-ph/0001128v1,The multi-phase nature of three intracluster media,"Among the models proposed to account for the new component of diffuse EUV and soft X-ray emission from clusters of galaxies (first discovered in Virgo) are two key contestants: the non-thermal scenario which postulates a population of relativistic electrons undergoing inverse-Compton (IC) interaction with the cosmic microwave background, and the original conjecture that the radiation is from a thermal warm gas at a temperature of $\sim$ 10$^{5-6}$ K. Currently a consensus set of limiting values on cosmological parameters favor the thermal gas interpretation. We also argued, based on pressure balance within the intracluster medium (ICM), that the non-thermal approach has formidable difficulties. Here we describe a spatial analysis of the soft X-ray excess emission of three clusters (Virgo, A2199, and Coma), using archival ROSAT/PSPC data, which reveals resolved features of cold intracluster clouds in absorption spreading over vast distances. Within the sample there is good indication that the soft excess radial trend (SERT, which qualitatively means a rising importance of the soft component with cluster radius) is due to a centrally peaked distribution of cold matter, with Coma having the least effect and no direct evidence for absorption. The data strongly suggest an intermixed ICM which contains gas masses at a wide range of temperatures, and the soft excess is due to a warm intermediate phase.",Massimiliano Bonamente; Richard Lieu,astro-ph,astro-ph

We suggest that in these binaries the companion stars are degenerate dwarfs with strong surface magnetic fields. The magnetospheres of these stars are permanently infused by the relativistic particles of the pulsar wind. We argue that the radio waves emitted by the pulsar split into the eigenmodes of the electron-positron plasma as they enter the companion's magnetosphere and are then strongly damped due to cyclotron resonance with the ambient plasma particles. Our model explains in a natural way the anomalous duration and behavior of radio eclipses observed in such systems. In particular, it provides stable, continuous, and frequency-dependent eclipses, in agreement with the observations. We predict a significant variation of linear polarization both at eclipse ingress and egress.

It is demonstrated that such waves can modify significantly curvature of these dipolar field lines. This in turn affects strongly fulfillment of the resonance conditions necessary for the excitation of radio waves.

We present data on the three flows associated with the Herbig-Haro objects HH 43/38 & HH 64, HH 65, and the L1641-N giant flow. HH 43, HH 38 and HH 64 are part of one H_2 flow extending over at least 1.4 pc.

The morphology of HH 43-IRS1 suggests that it is a star+disk system seen close to edge-on.

We find that the Coulomb scattering can not cause the spin dephasing, and that the electron-hole spin exchange is the main mechanism of the spin decoherence. Moreover the beat frequency in the Faraday rotation angle is determined mainly by the Zeeman splitting, red shifted by the Coulomb scattering and the electron hole spin exchange.

The power density spectra exhibit quasi-periodic oscillations (QPO) whose frequency increases with increasing count rate and varies in the frequency range 0.6-8 Hz. A correlation between the QPO frequency and the phase lag spectra is reported for the first time. This correlation is found for both the phase lag continuum and the phase lag at the QPO frequency. We find that as the QPO frequency moves to higher values the phase lags reverse sign from positive to negative. The absolute value of the lag always increases with photon energy. The negative (soft) lags are associated with a softer energy spectrum, whereas the positive (hard) lags are seen when the source is harder.

astro-ph/0001135v1,Theory and Observations of Type I X-Ray Bursts from Neutron Stars,"I review our understanding of the thermonuclear instabilities on accreting neutron stars that produce Type I X-Ray bursts. I emphasize those observational and theoretical aspects that should interest the broad audience of this meeting. The easily accessible timescales of the bursts (durations of tens of seconds and recurrence times of hours to days) allow for a very stringent comparison to theory. The largest discrepancy (which was found with EXOSAT observations) is the accretion rate dependence of the Type I burst properties. Bursts become less frequent and energetic as the global accretion rate increases, just the opposite of what the spherical theory predicts. I present a resolution of this issue by taking seriously the observed dependence of the burning area on the global accretion rate, which implies that as the accretion rate increases, the accretion rate per unit area decreases. This resurrects the unsolved problem of knowing where the freshly accreted material accumulates on the star, equally relevant to the likely signs of rotation during the bursts summarized by Swank at this meeting. I close by highlighting the Type I bursts from GS 1826-238 that were found with BeppoSAX and RXTE. Their energetics, recurrence times and temporal profiles clearly indicate that hydrogen is being burned during these bursts, most likely by the rapid-proton (rp) process.",Lars Bildsten,astro-ph,astro-ph

We observed behaviour consistent with thermodynamic expectations, i.e., C(H) decreases with field for ferromagnetic metallic compounds by an amount which is in quantitative agreement with spin wave theory. We also find that C(H) increases with field in most compounds with a charge-ordered antiferromagnetic ground state. In compounds which show evidence of a coexistence of ferromagnetic metallic and antiferromagnetic charge-ordered states, C(H) displays some unusual non-equilibrium effects presumably associated with the phase-separation of the two states. We also observe a large anomalous low temperature specific heat at the doping induced metal-insulator transition (at x = 0.50) in La_(1-x)Ca_(x)MnO_(3).",M. Roy; J. F. Mitchell; S. J. Potashnik; P.

astro-ph/0001136v2,"Deformations of Accreting Neutron Star Crusts and Gravitational Wave
  Emission","Motivated by the narrow range of spin frequencies of nearly 20 accreting neutron stars, Bildsten (1998) conjectured that their spin-up had been halted by the emission of gravitational waves. He also pointed out that small nonaxisymmetric temperature variations in the accreted crust will lead to ""wavy"" electron capture layers, whose horizontal density variations naturally create a mass quadrupole moment.   We present a full calculation of the crust's elastic adjustment to these density perturbations and find that the elastic response of the crust reduces Bildsten's original estimate of the quadrupole moment in the thin outer crust by a factor of 20-50. However, this basic picture, when applied to capture layers in the deep inner crust, can generate quadrupoles in the necessary range as long as there are ~5% lateral temperature variations in the inner crust. By calculating the thermal flow throughout the core and the crust, we find that temperature gradients this large are easily maintained by asymmetric heat sources or lateral composition gradients in the crust.   We also derive a general relation between the stresses and strains in the crust and the maximum quadrupole moment they can generate. We show under quite general conditions that maintaining a quadrupole of the magnitude necessary to balance the accretion torque requires dimensionless strains close to 0.01 at near-Eddington accretion rates, of order the breaking strain of conventional materials.",Greg Ushomirsky; Curt Cutler; Lars Bildsten,astro-ph,astro-ph; gr-qc

We analyze the spectrum of the evolution operator of the RDM and discover the existence of the quasitrapped states of the field mode. These states exist for a wide range of number of atoms in the cluster as well as for a broad range of relaxation rates.

Using these equations we find that continuous measurement of the unstable system does not affect its exponential decay to a reservoir with a constant density of states. The width of the energy distribution of the tunneling electron, however, is not equal to the inverse life-time -- it increases due to the decoherence generated by the detector. We extend the analysis to the case of a reservoir described by an energy dependent density of states, and we show that continuous measurement of such quantum systems affects both the exponential decay rate and the energy distribution.

Our BY Dra orbit is in good agreement with the spectroscopic results.

  Scalar Field on a Manifold with Boundary","The effect of quantum corrections to a conformally invariant field theory for a self-interacting scalar field on a curved manifold with boundary is considered. The analysis is most easily performed in a space of constant curvature the boundary of which is characterised by constant extrinsic curvature. An extension of the spherical formulation in the presence of a boundary is attained through use of the method of images. Contrary to the consolidated vanishing effect in maximally symmetric space-times the contribution of the massless ""tadpole"" diagram no longer vanishes in dimensional regularisation. As a result, conformal invariance is broken due to boundary-related vacuum contributions.

We show that this theory is related to the critical cracks of stressed solids, because the world lines of the atoms in the chain form a two-dimensional crystal, and the bounce is a crack configuration in (unstable) mechanical equilibrium. Thus the tunneling time, Action, and breaking rate in the limit of small forces are determined by the classical results of Griffith. For the limit of large forces we give an exact bounce solution that describes the quantum fracture and classical crack close to the limit of mechanical stability. This limit can be viewed as a critical phenomenon for which we establish a Levanyuk-Ginzburg criterion of weakness of fluctuations, and propose a scaling argument for the critical regime. The post-tunneling dynamics is understood by the analytic continuation of the bounce solutions to real time.",Eugene B. Kolomeisky; Joseph P. Straley,cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.stat-mech

The sample covers 2/3 (8.27 sr) of the sky ($|b|>20^{\circ}$) and appears to have a good completeness in redshift (98%). We select the sample on the basis of homogenized corrected total blue magnitudes in order to minimize systematic effects in galaxy sampling.   We identify the groups in this sample by means of both the hierarchical and the percolation {\it friends of friends} methods. The resulting catalogs of loose groups appear to be similar and are among the largest catalogs of groups presently available. Most of the NOG galaxies ($\sim$60%) are found to be members of galaxy pairs ($\sim$580 pairs for a total of $\sim$15% of objects) or groups with at least three members ($\sim$500 groups for a total of $\sim$45% of objects). About 40% of galaxies are left ungrouped (field galaxies). We illustrate the main features of the NOG galaxy distribution. Compared to previous optical and IRAS galaxy samples, the NOG provides a denser sampling of the galaxy distribution in the nearby universe.

astro-ph/0001137v3,Searching the Footprint of WIMPZILLAs,"We constrain mass, lifetime and contribution of a very slowly decaying Ultra Heavy Dark Matter (UHDM) by simulating the cosmological evolution of its remnants. Most of interactions which participate in energy dissipation are included in the numerical solution of the Boltzmann equation. Cross-sections are calculated either analytically or by using PYTHIA Monte Carlo program. This paper describes in detail our simulation. To show the importance of the distribution of matter in constraining WIMPZILLA characteristics, we consider two extreme cases: a homogeneous universe, and a local halo with uniform distribution. We show that in a homogeneous universe, the decay of UHDM with a mass \sim 10^15 GeV and a lifetime \sim a few times \tau_0 the age of the Universe, can not explain the flux of observed Ultra High Energy Cosmic Rays (UHECRs). This shows the importance of nearby sources, notably galactic halo. In a uniform clump with an over-density of \sim 200 extended to 100 kpc or more, the lifetime must be \sim 10 - 100 \tau_0 or the contribution in the DM must be proportionally smaller.

  AdS/CFT correspondence","We compute the conformal anomaly of free d=6 superconformal (2,0) tensor multiplet on generic curved background. Up to a trivial covariant total-derivative term, it is given by the sum of the type A part proportional to the 6-d Euler density, and the type B part containing three independent Weyl invariants. Multiplied by factor 4N^3, the type B part of the anomaly reproduces exactly the corresponding part of the conformal anomaly of large N multiple M5-brane (2,0) theory as predicted (hep-th/9806087) by the AdS/CFT correspondence. The coefficients of the type A anomaly differ by the factor 4/7 x 4 N^3, so that the free tensor multiplet anomaly does not vanish on a Ricci-flat background. The coefficient 4N^3 is the same as found (hep-th/9703040) in the comparison of the tensor multiplet theory and the d=11 supergravity results for the absorption cross-sections of gravitons by M5 branes, and in the comparison (hep-th/9911135) of 2- and 3-point stress tensor correlators of the free tensor multiplet with the AdS_7 supergravity predictions. The reason for this coincidence is that the three Weyl-invariant terms in the anomaly are related to the $h^2$ and $h^3$ terms in the near flat space expansion of the corresponding non-local effective action, and thus to the 2-point and 3-point stress tensor correlators in flat background. At the same time, the type A anomaly is related to the $h^4$ term in the non-local part of the effective action, i.e. to a certain structure in the 4-point correlation function of stress tensors.",F.

cs/0001006v1,"Compositionality, Synonymy, and the Systematic Representation of Meaning","In a recent issue of Linguistics and Philosophy Kasmi and Pelletier (1998) (K&P), and Westerstahl (1998) criticize Zadrozny's (1994) argument that any semantics can be represented compositionally. The argument is based upon Zadrozny's theorem that every meaning function m can be encoded by a function \mu such that (i) for any expression E of a specified language L, m(E) can be recovered from \mu(E), and (ii) \mu is a homomorphism from the syntactic structures of L to interpretations of L.   In both cases, the primary motivation for the objections brought against Zadrozny's argument is the view that his encoding of the original meaning function does not properly reflect the synonymy relations posited for the language.   In this paper, we argue that these technical criticisms do not go through. In particular, we prove that \mu properly encodes synonymy relations, i.e. if two expressions are synonymous, then their compositional meanings are identical. This corrects some misconceptions about the function \mu, e.g. Janssen (1997).   We suggest that the reason that semanticists have been anxious to preserve compositionality as a significant constraint on semantic theory is that it has been mistakenly regarded as a condition that must be satisfied by any theory that sustains a systematic connection between the meaning of an expression and the meanings of its parts. Recent developments in formal and computational semantics show that systematic theories of meanings need not be compositional.",Shalom Lappin; Wlodek Zadrozny,cs.CL,cs.CL; cs.LO; I.2.7; F.4.1

Spectral observations reveal both components to be z = 2.24 quasars, with relative redshifts that agree at the 100 km/s level, but exhibit pronounced differences in the equivalent widths of related emission features, as well as an enhancement of blue continuum flux in the brighter component longward of the Ly alpha emission feature. In general, similar redshift double quasars can be the result of a physical binary pair, or a single quasar multiply imaged by gravitational lensing. Empirical PSF subtraction of R and H band images of CTQ 839 reveal no indication of a lensing galaxy, and place a detection limit of R = 22.5 and H = 17.4 for a third component in the system. For an Einstein-de Sitter cosmology and SIS model, the R band detection limit constrains the characteristics of any lensing galaxy to z_lens >= 1 with a corresponding luminosity of L >~ 5 L_*, while an analysis based on the redshift probability distribution for the lensing galaxy argues against the existence of a z_lens >~ 1 lens at the 2 sigma level. A similar analysis for a Lambda dominated cosmology, however, does not significantly constrain the existence of any lensing galaxy. The broadband flux differences, spectral dissimilarities, and failure to detect a lensing galaxy make the lensing hypothesis for CTQ 839 unlikely. The similar redshifts of the two components would then argue for a physical quasar binary.

In {\em Avida} the organisms don't interact with each other, merely reproduce at a particular rate (their fitness), and attempt to evaluate an externally given arithmetic function in order win bonus fitness points. Measuring the information content of a digital organism is essentially a process of counting the number of genotypes that give rise to the same phenotype.   Whilst Avidan organisms have a particularly simple phenotype, Tierran organisms interact with each other, giving rise to an ecology of phenotypes. In this paper, I discuss techniques for comparing pairs of Tierran organisms to determine if they are phenotypically equivalent. I then discuss a method for computing an estimate of the number of phenotypically equivalent genotypes that is more accurate than the ``hot site'' estimate used by Adami's group.

  doped cuprates","We examine the role of spin twists in the formation of domain walls, often called stripes, by focusing on the spin textures found in the cluster spin glass phases of LaSrCuO and YCaBaCuO. To this end, we derive an analytic expression for the spin distortions produced by a frustrating bond, both near the core region of the bond and in the far field, and then derive an expression for interaction energies between such bonds. We critique our analytical theory by comparison to numerical solutions of this problem and find excellent agreement. By looking at collections of small numbers of such bonds localized in some region of a lattice, we demonstrate the stability of small ``clusters'' of spins, each cluster having its own orientation of its antiferromagnetic order parameter. Then, we display a domain wall corresponding to spin twists between clusters of locally ordered spins showing how spin twists can serve as a mechanism for stripe formation. Since the charges are localized in this model, we emphasize that these domain walls are produced in a situation for which no kinetic energy is present in the problem.",K. S. D. Beach; R. J.

In contrast to the quantization of traditional vector field, the quantization of the new vector field is carried out in a natural way. The Lorentz invariance of the theory is discussed, where owing to an interesting feature of the new vector field, the Lorentz invariance has a special meaning. In term of formalism analogical to QED(i. e. spinor QED), we develop the quantum electrodynamics concerning the new spin-1 particles, say, vector QED, where the Feynman rules are given. The renormalizability of vector QED is manifest without the aid of Higgs mechanism. As an example, the polarization cross section $\sigma_{polar}$ for $e^+ e^-\to f^+ f^-$ is calculated in the lowest order. It turns out that $\sigma_{polar}\sim 0$ and the momentum of $f^+$ and $f^-$ is purely longitudinal.",Zhiyong Wang; Ailin Zhang,hep-th,hep-th
astro-ph/0001142v1,Gas Rich Dwarf Spheroidals,"We present evidence that nearly half of the dwarf spheroidal galaxies (dSph and dSph/dIrr) in the Local Group are associated with large reservoirs of atomic gas, in some cases larger than the stellar mass. The gas is sometimes found at large distance (~10 kpc) from the center of a galaxy and is not necessarily centered on it. Similarly large quantities of ionized gas could be hidden in these systems as well. The properties of some of the gas reservoirs are similar to the median properties of the High-Velocity Clouds (HVCs); two of the HI reservoirs are catalogued HVCs. The association of the HI with the dwarf spheroidals might thus provide a link between the HVCs and stars. We show that the HI content of the Local Group dSphs and dIrrs exhibits a sharp decline if the galaxy is within 250 kpc of either the Milky Way or M31. This can be explained if both galaxies have a sufficiently massive x-ray emitting halo that produces ram-pressure stripping if a dwarf ventures too close to either giant spiral. We also investigate tidal stripping of the dwarf galaxies and find that although it may play a role, it cannot explain the apparent total absence of neutral gas in most dSph galaxies at distances less than 250 kpc. For the derived mean density of the hot gas, n_0 = 2.5e-5 cm^-2, ram-pressure stripping is found to be more than an order of magnitude more effective in removing the gas from the dSph galaxies. The hot halo, with an inferred mass of 1e10 solar masses, may represent a reservoir of ~1000 destroyed dwarf systems, either HVCs or true dwarf galaxies similar to those we observe now.",Leo Blitz; Timothy Robishaw,astro-ph,astro-ph
hep-ph/0001062v2,Quarkonium momentum distributions in photoproduction and B decay,"According to our present understanding many $J/\psi$ production processes proceed through a coloured $c\bar{c}$ state followed by the emission of soft particles in the quarkonium rest frame. The kinematic effect of soft particle emission is usually a higher-order effect in the non-relativistic expansion, but becomes important near the kinematic endpoint of quarkonium energy (momentum) distributions. In an intermediate region a systematic resummation of the non-relativistic expansion leads to the introduction of so-called `shape functions'. In this paper we provide an implementation of the kinematic effect of soft gluon emission which is consistent with the non-relativistic shape function formalism in the region where it is applicable and which models the extreme endpoint region. We then apply the model to photoproduction of $J/\psi$ and $J/\psi$ production in $B$ meson decay. A satisfactory description of $B$ decay data is obtained.

  Region of the Abell 1060 Cluster of Galaxies","X-ray spectral and imaging data from ASCA and ROSAT were used to measure the total mass profile in the central region of Abell 1060, a nearby and relatively poor cluster of galaxies. The ASCA X-ray spectra, after correcting for the spatial response of the X-ray telescope, show an isothermal distribution of the intra-cluster medium (ICM) within at least $\sim$ 12' (or $160h_{70}^{-1}$ kpc; $H_0 = 70 h_{70}$ km s$^{-1}$Mpc$^{-1}$) in radius of the cluster center. The azimuthally averaged surface brightness profile from the ROSAT PSPC exhibits a central excess above an isothermal $\beta$ model. The ring-sorted ASCA GIS spectra and the radial surface brightness distribution from the ROSAT PSPC were simultaneously utilized to constrain the gravitational potential profile. Some analytic models of the total mass density profile were examined. The ICM density profile was also specified by analytic forms. The ICM temperature distribution was constrained to satisfy the hydrostatic equilibrium, and to be consistent with the data. Then, the total mass distribution was found to be described better by the universal dark halo profile proposed by Navarro, Frenk, and White (1996;1997) than by a King-type model with a flat density core. A profile with a central cusp together with a logarithmic radial slope of $\sim 1.5$ was also consistent with the data.

By working in the rest-frame instant form of dynamics, the elimination of the electromagnetic degrees of freedom by means of suitable second classs contraints leads to the identification of the Lienard-Wiechert reduced phase space containing only N charged particles with mutual action-at-a-distance vector and scalar potentials. A Darboux canonical basis of the reduced phase space is found. This allows one to re-express the potentials for arbitrary N as a unique effective scalar potential containing the Coulomb potential and the complete Darwin one, whose 1/c^2 component agrees for with the known expression. The effective potential gives the classical analogue of all static and non-static effects of the one-photon exchange Feynman diagram of scalar electrodynamics.",Horace Crater; Luca Lusanna,hep-th,hep-th; hep-ph; math-ph; math.MP; nucl-th; physics.class-ph

These new analytic approximations, the SPP-approximants, are not only `effectual' for detection and `faithful' for parameter estimation, but are also computationally inexpensive to generate (and are `faster' by factors up to 10, as compared to the corresponding time-domain templates).

astro-ph/0001144v1,The Chemical Composition of Carbon Stars II: The J-type stars,"Abundances of Li, heavy elements and carbon isotope ratios have been measured in 12 J-type galactic carbon stars. The abundance analysis shows that in these stars the abundances of s-process elements with respect to the metallicity are nearly normal. Tc is not present in most of them, although upper limits have been derived for WZ Cas and WX Cyg, perhaps two SC-type rather than J-type carbon stars. The Rb abundances, obtained from the resonance 7800 {\AA} Rb I line, are surprisingly low, probably due to strong non-LTE effects in the formation of this line in cool carbon-rich stars. Lithium and $^{13}$C are found to be enhanced in all the stars. These results together with the nitrogen abundances and oxygen isotope ratios measured by Lambert et al. (1986) and Harris et al. (1987) are used to discuss the origin of J-stars. The luminosity and variability class of the stars studied would indicate that they are low mass (M$\leq 2-3$ M$_\odot$), less evolved objects than the normal carbon stars, although the presence of some luminous (M$_{bol}<-5.5$) J-stars in our galaxy (WZ Cas may be an example) and in other galaxies, suggests the existence of at least two types of J-stars, with different formation scenarios depending upon the initial mass of the parent star. Standard evolutionary AGB models are difficult to reconcile with all the observed chemical characteristics. In fact, they suggest the existence of an extra-mixing mechanism which transports material from the convective envelope down to hotter regions where some nuclear burning occurs. This mechanism would act preferably on the early-AGB phase in low-mass stars. Mixing at the He-core flash and the binary system hypothesis are also discussed as alternatives to the above scenario.",Carlos Abia; Jordi Isern,astro-ph,astro-ph

Because of the nonlinearity of the theory the internal dynamics of a galaxy is affected by a perturber over and above possible tidal effects. For example, a relatively distant and light companion or the mean influence of a parent cluster, with negligible tidal effects, could still produce a significant warp in the outer part of a galactic disk. We present results of numerical calculations for simplified models that show, for instance, that a satellite with the (baryonic) mass and distance of the Magellanic clouds can distort the axisymmetric field of the Milky Way enough to produce a warp of the magnitude (and position) observed. Details of the warp geometry remain to be explained: we use a static configuration that can produce only warps with a straight line of nodes.

At the same time, layer occupancy is found at each jump to switch from close to full to close to half, indicating a disordered flat (DOF) surface and establishing preroughening as the underlying mechanism.

The external field problem and Klein's paradox are discussed and then resolved by introducing the so-called fermionic projector, a global object in space-time which generalizes the notion of the Dirac sea. The mathematical core of the book is to give a precise definition of the fermionic projector and to employ methods of hyperbolic differential equations for its detailed analysis. The fermionic projector makes it possible to formulate a new type of variational principles in space-time. The mathematical tools for the analysis of the corresponding Euler-Lagrange equations are developed.

The results are generalized to more general systems of linear inequalities whose homogeneous versions define the semigroup in a not necessarily irredundant way. The ideals arising this way can also be considered as defined by the non-negative solutions of an inhomogeneous system of linear diophantine equations.   We also give a more ring-theoretic approach to the theorem on minimal number of generators of divisorial ideals: it turns out to be a special instance of a theorem on the growth of multigraded Hilbert functions.",W.

The gravitational interactions are obtained using the boundary state formalism while the SO(32) gauge interactions are determined by evaluating disk diagrams with suitable insertions of boundary changing (or twist) operators. In particular the gauge coupling of a D-particle is obtained from a disk with two boundary components produced by the insertion of two twist operators. We also compare our results with the amplitudes among the non-BPS states of the heterotic string which are dual to the D-particles. After taking into account the known duality and renormalization effects, we find perfect agreement, thus confirming at a non-BPS level the expectations based on the heterotic/type I duality.",L.

hep-ph/0001067v1,Electromagnetic properties of a neutrino stream,"In a medium that contains a neutrino background in addition to the matter particles, the neutrinos contribute to the photon self-energy as a result of the effective electromagnetic vertex that they acquire in the presence of matter. We calculate the contribution to the photon self-energy in a dense plasma, due to the presence of a gas of charged particles, or neutrinos, that moves as a whole relative to the plasma. General formulas for the transverse and longitudinal components of the photon polarization tensor are obtained in terms of the momentum distribution functions of the particles in the medium, and explicit results are given for various limiting cases of practical interest. The formulas are used to study the electromagnetic properties of a plasma that contains a beam of neutrinos. The transverse and longitudinal photon dispersion relations are studied in some detail. Our results do not support the idea that neutrino streaming instabilities can develop in such a system. We also indicate how the phenomenon of optical activity of the neutrino gas is modified due to the velocity of the neutrino background relative to the plasma.

At least one third of all systems are numerous foreground Galactic Disk projections over long lines of sight to the clusters. Since the selection of the cluster members has been based on the MV(logP, color) calibrations, the matter of a metallicity-correction required particular attention with the result that such a correction is apparently not needed at the present level of accuracy. Analysis of the color-magnitude and period-color relations shows that globular cluster members are under-luminous relative to the Galactic Disk contact systems mainly because of the smaller sizes and, consequently, shorter orbital periods; the color-index effect of the diminished blanketing is less important, especially for (V-I). The variability amplitudes for the Blue Straggler systems show a significantly different distribution from that for systems below the Turn Off Point (TOP): The BS systems show only small amplitudes while the distribution for the systems below the TOP is peculiar in containing only large amplitude systems. This difference is linked to an observational selection effect so that efforts at determining the frequency of occurrence of the contact systems below the TOP have been judged to be premature; the frequency among the BS stars could be at about 45+-10 BS stars per one contact BS binary.",Slavek M.

  clustering","We examine the necessity of resolving the Jeans mass in hydrodynamical simulations of the hierarchical formation of cosmological structures. We consider a standard two-component fluid and use smoothed particle hydrodynamics to model the baryonic component. It is found that resolution of the Jeans mass is not necessary to extract bulk properties of bound objects that are independent of resolution, provided that the objects have undergone a number of merger events. The degree of merging must be sufficient to populate the objects with substructure of similar total mass. After this criterion is met, neither the density profiles of structures nor their density-temperature distributions depend appreciably on the resolution of the simulation. Resolution of the Jeans mass by the imposition of a minimum temperature is not found to adversely affect the state of the matter in the final clusters. The baryon concentration profiles still indicate a deficit of gas with respect to the dark matter in the interiors of structures.",Eric R. Tittley; H. M. P. Couchman,astro-ph,astro-ph

ELF is a ground-state property which discriminates in a very sharp, quantitative, way between different kinds of bonding. ELF shows that in the bulk of Al the electron distribution is essentially jelliumlike, while what happens at the surface strongly depends on packing. At the least packed surface, Al(110), ELF indicates a free-atom nature of the electron distribution in the outer region. The most packed surface, Al(111), is instead at the opposite end, and can be regarded as a jellium surface weakly perturbed by the presence of the ionic cores.",L. De Santis; R.

Ground-based observations have shown that NGC 5907 has a luminous halo with a shallow radial profile between 4 and 8 kpc that roughly traces the dark matter distribution of the galaxy deduced from its rotation curve. Our NICMOS observations were designed to resolve bright giants in the halo of NGC 5907 to constrain its stellar composition with the goal of understanding its nature and origin. More than 100 stars are expected in the NICMOS images if the dwarf-to-giant ratio in the halo of NGC 5907 is consistent with that expected from standard stellar initial mass functions, and if ground-based estimates of the distance to NGC 5907 and the integrated colors of its halo are correct. Instead we observe only one candidate giant star. This apparent discrepancy can be resolved by assuming either a significantly larger distance than suggested by several studies, or a halo metallicity much lower than suggested by ground-based colors and as low as metal-poor Galactic globular clusters. If previous distance and halo color estimates for NGC 5907 are correct, our NICMOS results suggest that its extended light is composed of stars that formed with an initial mass function different than that observed locally, leading to a much higher ratio of dwarfs to giants. We describe how these three possible explanations for the absence of bright giants in our NICMOS images of the halo of NGC 5907 might be constrained by future observations.",Stephen E.

SWS02 and LWS01 spectra have been taken towards the star and the brightest infrared filaments located NW and SW from the star (hereafter NW and SW PDRs). In addition, SWS02 spectra have been taken towards two intermediate positions.   While all the PDR tracers (the [CII] 157.7$\mic$, [OI] 63.2 and 145.6$\mic$, [HI] 21cm and the H$_2$ rotational lines) present a ring-like morphology with the peaks toward the NW and SW PDRs and a minimum around the star, the SiII emission is filling the hole of this ring with the peak towards the star. This morphology can only be explained if the SiII emission arise in the lowest extinction layers of the PDR (A$_v$ $<$ 2 mag) and the HII region. At least 20% -- 30% of the Si must be in gas phase in these layers. For A$_v$ $\geq$ 2 mag, the Si is mainly in solid form ($\delta$ Si = -1.3).   In both, the NW and SW PDRs, the intensities of the H$_2$ rotational lines can only be fitted by assuming an ortho-to-para-H$_2$ ratio lower than 3 in gas with rotation temperatures from 400 to 700 K. Therefore, there is a non-equilibrium OTP ratio in the region. The comparison between the OTP ratio derived from H$_2$ vibrational lines and the pure H$_2$ rotational lines, shows that the OTP ratio increases from $\sim$ 1.5 to 3 across the photodissociation region with larger values in the less shielded gas (A$_v$$<$ 0.7 mag).

Here we report on the spectroscopic identification of 9 Ly alpha emitters at z=3.13, obtained with the FORS spectrograph at Unit 1 of the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT UT1). The spectra of these high redshift objects show a narrow, isolated Ly alpha emission with very faint (frequently undetected) continuum, indicating a large equivalent width. No other features are visible in our spectra. Our Ly alpha emitters are quite similar to those found by Hu (1998), Cowie & Hu (1998) and Hu et al. (1998). Using simple population synthesis models, on the assumption that these sources are regions of star formation, we conclude that the nebulae are nearly optically thick and must have a very low dust content, in order to explain the high observed Ly alpha equivalent widths. For the cosmological and star formation parameters we adopted, the total stellar mass produced would seem to correspond to the formation of rather small galaxies, some of which are perhaps destined to merge. The implied star formation density in our sampled comoving volume is probably somewhat smaller than, but of the same order of magnitude as the star formation density at z=3 derived by other authors from Lyman-break galaxy surveys. This result agrees with the expectation that the Ly alpha emitters are a low-metallicity (or low-dust) tail in a distribution of star forming regions at high redshifts.

This poses severe problems for stellar MACHO candidates, and leads to the consideration of more exotic objects such as primordial black holes (PBHs). Constraining the MACHO mass function will shed light on their nature. Using the current data we find, for four halo models, the best fit delta-function, power law and PBH mass functions. The best fit PBH mass functions, despite having significant finite width, have likelihoods which are similar to, and for one particular halo model greater than, those of the best fit delta functions. We also find that if the correct halo model is known then $\sim$ 500 events will be sufficient to determine whether the MACHO mass function has significant width, and will also allow determination of the mass function parameters to $\sim 5%$.",Anne M Green,astro-ph,astro-ph

The spectrum of the bright central star is similar to unobscured stars with MK spectral types of O5-O6.5. If this star is on the zero age main sequence, then the derived spectrophotometric distance is considerably smaller than previous estimates. The Lyman continuum luminosity of the cluster is a few times that of the Trapezium.

  Candidate XTE J1550-564: A New Interpretation of Black Hole States","We present an analysis of RXTE data of the X-ray transient XTE J1550-564. The source went through several states, which were divided into spectrally soft and hard states. These states showed up as distinct branches in the color-color diagram, forming a structure with a comb-like topology; the soft state branch forming the spine and the hard state branches forming the teeth. Variability was strongly correlated with the position on the branches. The broad band noise became stronger, and changed from power law like to band limited, as the spectrum became harder. Three types of QPOs were found: 1-18 Hz and 102-284 Hz QPOs on the hard branches, and 16-18 Hz QPOs on and near the soft branch. The frequencies of the high and low frequency QPOs on the hard branches were correlated with each other, and anti-correlated with spectral hardness. The changes in QPO frequency suggest that the inner disc radius only increases by a factor of 3-4 as the source changes from a soft to a hard state. Our results on XTE J1550-564 strongly favor a 2-dimensional description of black hole behavior, where the regions near the spine of the comb in the color-color diagram can be identified with the high state, and the teeth with transitions from the high state, via the intermediate state (which includes the very high state) to the low state, and back. The two physical parameters underlying this behavior vary to a large extent independently and could for example be the mass accretion rate through the disk and the size of a Comptonizing region.",Jeroen Homan; Rudy Wijnands; Michiel van der Klis; Tomaso Belloni; Jan van Paradijs; Marc Klein-Wolt; Rob Fender; Mariano Mendez,astro-ph,astro-ph

hep-ph/0001072v1,Families as Neighbors in Extra Dimension,"We propose a new mechanism for explanation of the fermion hierarchy without introducing any family symmetries. Instead, we postulate that different generations live on different branes embedded in a relatively large extra dimension, where the gauge fields can propagate. The electroweak symmetry is broken on a separate brane, which is a source of exponentially decaying Higgs profile in the bulk. The resulting fermion masses and mixings are determined by an exponentially suppressed overlap of the fermion and Higgs wave functions and are automatically hierarchical even if all copies are identical and there is no hierarchy of distances. In this framework the well known pattern of the ""nearest neighbor mixing"" is predicted due to the fact that the families are literally neighbors in the extra space. This picture may also provide a new way of a hierarchically weak supersymmetry breaking, provided that the combination of three family branes is a non-BPS configuration, although each of them, individually taken, is. This results in exponentially weak supersymmetry breaking. We also discuss the issue of embedding identical branes in the compact spaces and localization of the fermionic zero modes.",G. Dvali; M.

In the process, we analyse -- in the most general context -- the impact of stochastic variables on the P&L of a hedged portfolio, and we conclude that no model can a priori be expected to price all exotics in line with the vanilla options market. Calibration of an assumed underlying process from vanilla options alone must not be overly restrictive, yet still unique, and relevant to all exotic options of interest. For the implied tree we show that the calibration to real-world prices allows us to only price vanilla options themselves correctly. This is usually attributed to the incompleteness of the market under traditional stochastic (local) volatility models. We show that some `weakly' stochastic volatility models without quadratic variation of the volatilities avoid the incompleteness problems, but they introduce arbitrage. More generally, we find that any stochastic tradable either has quadratic variation -- and therefore a $\Ga$-like P&L on instruments with non-linear exposure to that asset -- or it introduces arbitrage opportunities.",Karl Strobl,cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.stat-mech; math.AP; physics.data-an; q-fin.ST

The properties of the saturated state depend on the initial magnetic field configuration. In simulations with an initial uniform vertical field, the MRI is able to support angular momentum transport even for large resistivities through the quasi-periodic generation of axisymmetric radial channel solutions rather than through the maintenance of anisotropic turbulence. Simulations with zero net flux show that the angular momentum transport and the amplitude of magnetic energy after saturation are significantly reduced by finite resistivity, even at levels where the linear modes are only slightly affected. This occurs at magnetic Reynolds numbers expected in low, cool states of dwarf novae, these results suggest that finite resistivity may account for the low and high angular momentum transport rates inferred for these systems.",Timothy P.

astro-ph/0001160v2,The Synchrotron Spectrum of Fast Cooling Electrons Revisited,"We discuss the spectrum arising from synchrotron emission by fast cooling (FC) electrons, when fresh electrons are continually accelerated by a strong blast wave, into a power law distribution of energies. The FC spectrum was so far described by four power law segments divided by three break frequencies $\nu_{sa} < \nu_{c} < \nu_{m}$. This is valid for a homogeneous electron distribution. However, hot electrons are located right after the shock, while most electrons are farther down stream and have cooled. This spatial distribution changes the optically thick part of the spectrum, introducing a new break frequency, $\nu_{ac} < \nu_{sa}$, and a new spectral slope, $F_{\nu }\propto \nu^{11/8}$ for $\nu_{ac} < \nu < \nu_{sa}$. The familiar $F_{\nu }\propto \nu ^{2}$ holds only for $\nu < \nu_{ac}$. This ordering of the break frequencies is relevant for typical gamma-ray burst (GRB) afterglows in an ISM environment. Other possibilities arise for internal shocks or afterglows in dense circumstellar winds. We discuss possible implications of this spectrum for GRBs and their afterglows, in the context of the internal-external shock model. Observations of $F_{\nu} \propto \nu^{11/8}$ would enable us to probe scales much smaller than the typical size of the system, and constrain the amount of turbulent mixing behind the shock.",Jonathan Granot; Tsvi Piran; Re'em Sari,astro-ph,astro-ph

It is argued that a class of such singularities is relevant for the study of non-trivial IR fixed points that appear in the moduli space of four-dimensional N=2 SQCD: SU(N_c) gauge theory with matter in the fundamental representation. This includes the origin in the moduli space of the SU(N_c) gauge theory with N_f=2N_c fundamentals.

There is no limit to the charge of the black hole, which gives us the possibility of observing Z>137 bound states and transitions at the lower continuum. Negatively charged black holes can capture protons. For Z>1, the orbiting protons will coalesce to form a nucleus (after beta-decay of some protons to neutrons), with a stability curve different to that of free nuclei.

They are separated by 4300 km/s in radial velocity and 17 arcminutes on the plane of the sky. Their physical and redshift proximity suggested a promising supercluster candidate. Deep BRi imaging of the region between the two clusters indicates a large population of red galaxies. This population forms a tight, red sequence in the color--magnitude diagram at (R-i) = 1.4.

The Dirac equation, in the case of electromagnetic interaction, is not invariant under unitary time inversion, giving rise to a ``Klein paradox''. To render unitary time inversion invariance, a nonlinear wave equation is constructed, in which the ``Klein paradox'' disappears. In the case of Coulomb interaction, the revised nonlinear equation can be linearized to give energy solutions for Hydrogen-like ions without singularity when nuclear number $Z>137$, showing a reversed energy order pending for experimental tests such as Zeeman effects. In non-relativistic limit, this nonlinear equation reduces to nonlinear schr\""odinger equation with soliton-like solutions. Moreover, particle conjugation and electron-proton scattering with a nonsingular current-potential interaction are discussed. Finally the explicit form of gauge function is found, the uniqueness of Lorentz gauge is proven and the Lagrangian density of quantum electrodynamics (QED) is revised as well. The implementation of unitary time inversion leads to the ultimate derivation of nonlinear QED.",Wei Min Jin,quant-ph,quant-ph; gr-qc; hep-th; nlin.PS; physics.atom-ph

Three new phenomena are observed from low-mass X-ray binaries containing low-magnetic-field neutron stars: millisecond pulsations, burst oscillations and kiloHertz quasi-periodic oscillations. Models for these new phenomena involve the neutron star spin, and orbital motion closely around the neutron star and rely explicitly on our understanding of strong gravity and dense matter.

  sources","The apparent position angle difference $\Delta$PA between parsec and kilo-parsec jets in blazars can be related to the bending properties of the jets. We present correlations between the misalignment $\Delta$PA and the ratio of radio to broad-line emission for a sample of $\gamma$-ray blazars. The present study is limited to EGRET sources due to uniform data for the radio and optical properties of these sources being easily available. The broad-line emission is known to be a good indicator of the accretion power for both steep and flat-spectrum quasars. We find significant correlations between $\Delta$PA and the ratio of radio flux (total and radio core flux respectively) to broad-line flux, which is consistent with the beaming scenario. A weak correlation between $\Delta$PA and the ratio of extended radio to broad-line flux might imply that the intrinsic bend of the jet is related with the ratio of jet mechanical power to accretion power.",Xinwu Cao,astro-ph,astro-ph

quant-ph/0001031v1,Bound states of neutral particles in external electric fields,"Neutral fermions of spin $\frac 12$ with magnetic moment can interact with electromagnetic fields through nonminimal coupling. The Dirac--Pauli equation for such a fermion coupled to a spherically symmetric or central electric field can be reduced to two simultaneous ordinary differential equations by separation of variables in spherical coordinates. For a wide variety of central electric fields, bound-state solutions of critical energy values can be found analytically. The degeneracy of these energy levels turns out to be numerably infinite. This reveals the possibility of condensing infinitely many fermions into a single energy level. For radially constant and radially linear electric fields, the system of ordinary differential equations can be completely solved, and all bound-state solutions are obtained in closed forms. The radially constant field supports scattering solutions as well. For radially linear fields, more energy levels (in addition to the critical one) are infinitely degenerate. The simultaneous presence of central magnetic and electric fields is discussed.",Qiong-gui Lin,quant-ph,quant-ph; hep-th
gr-qc/0001025v1,"The self-force on a static scalar test-charge outside a Schwarzschild
  black hole","The finite part of the self-force on a static scalar test-charge outside a Schwarzschild black hole is zero. By direct construction of Hadamard's elementary solution, we obtain a closed-form expression for the minimally coupled scalar field produced by a test-charge held fixed in Schwarzschild spacetime. Using the closed-form expression, we compute the necessary external force required to hold the charge stationary. Although the energy associated with the scalar field contributes to the renormalized mass of the particle (and thereby its weight), we find there is no additional self-force acting on the charge. This result is unlike the analogous electrostatic result, where, after a similar mass renormalization, there remains a finite repulsive self-force acting on a static electric test-charge outside a Schwarzschild black hole. We confirm our force calculation using Carter's mass-variation theorem for black holes. The primary motivation for this calculation is to develop techniques and formalism for computing all forces - dissipative and non-dissipative - acting on charges and masses moving in a black-hole spacetime. In the Appendix we recap the derivation of the closed-form electrostatic potential. We also show how the closed-form expressions for the fields are related to the infinite series solutions.",Alan G.

When the double-height steps are allowed, two single-height steps can merge into a double-height step (step doubling). We find that the step doubling reduces repulsive interaction strength between single-height steps and that the disordered flat phase is suppressed. As a control parameter a step doubling energy is introduced, which is assigned to each step doubling vertex. From transfer matrix type finite-size-scaling studies of interface free energies, we obtain the phase diagram in the parameter space of the step energy, the interaction energy, and the step doubling energy.",Jae Dong Noh,cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.stat-mech

astro-ph/0001169v1,Formation of Primordial Galaxies under UV background Radiation,"The pancake collapse of pregalactic clouds under UV background radiation is explored with a one-dimensional sheet model. Here, attention is concentrated on elucidating the basic physics on the thermal evolution of pregalactic clouds exposed to diffuse UV radiation. So, we treat accurately the radiation transfer for the ionizing photons, with solving chemical reactions regarding hydrogen molecules as well as atoms. The self-shielding against UV radiation by H$_2$ Lyman-Werner bands, which regulates the photo-dissociation of hydrogen molecules, is also taken into account. As a result, it is found that when the UV background radiation is at a level of $10^{-22} (\nu/\nu_L)^{-1} {\rm erg~ s^{-1} cm^{-2} Hz^{-1} str^{-1}}$, the cloud evolution bifurcates with a critical mass as $M_{\rm SB} = 2.2\times 10^{11} M_\odot [(1+z_c)/5]^{-4.2}$, where $z_c$ is the final collapse epoch. A cloud more massive than $M_{\rm SB}$ cools below $5\times 10^3$K due to H$_2$ line emission at the pancake collapse and would undergo the initial starburst. The pancake possibly evolves into a virialized system in a dissipationless fashion. Consequently, this leads to the dissipationless galaxy formation at $3\lsim z_c \lsim 10$. A cloud less massive than $M_{\rm SB}$ cannot cool by H$_2$ emission shortly after the pancake collapse, but could cool in the course of shrinking to the rotation barrier. This is likely to lead to the dissipational galaxy formation at relatively low redshifts as $0\lsim z_c \lsim 4$. The present results provide a solid physical mechanism which controls the star formation efficiency in the pregalactic clouds. In the context of a standard CDM cosmology, $M_{\rm SB}$ lies between 1$\sigma$ and 2$\sigma$ density fluctuations.",Hajime Susa; Masayuki Umemura,astro-ph,astro-ph

As is well known, the Stefan-Boltzmann constant extracted from SU(2) lattice gauge theory by incorporating finite size effects is smaller than the continuum value which assumes three gluon degrees of freedom. On the other hand, the extrapolation of our SO(3) lattice data comes much closer to the continuum value.

astro-ph/0001170v1,Synthesis of 19F in Wolf-Rayet stars,"Meynet and Arnould (1993) have suggested that Wolf-Rayet (WR) stars could significantly contaminate the Galaxy with 19F. In their scenario, 19F is synthesized at the beginning of the He-burning phase from the 14N left over by the previous CNO-burning core, and is ejected in the interstellar medium when the star enters its WC phase. Recourse to CNO seeds makes the 19F yields metallicity-dependent. These yields are calculated on grounds of detailed stellar evolutionary sequences for an extended range of initial masses (from 25 to 120 Msol) and metallicities (Z = 0.008, 0.02 and 0.04). The adopted mass loss rate prescription enables to account for the observed variations of WR populations in different environments. The 19F abundance in the WR winds of 60 Msol model stars is found to be about 10 to 70 times higher than its initial value, depending on the metallicity. This prediction is used in conjunction with a very simple model for the chemical evolution of the Galaxy to predict that WR stars could be significant (dominant?) contributors to the solar system fluorine content.

It was suggested that KK modes can be enhanced by an oscillation of a scale of compactification by the $d$-dimensional sphere $S^d~(d=D-4)$ and by the direct product $S^{d_1}\times S^{d_2}~(d_1+d_2=D-4)$. We extend this past work to the more general case where initial values of the scale of compactification and the quantum number of the angular momentum $l$ of KK modes are not small. We perform analytic approaches based on the Mathieu equation as well as numerical calculations, and find that the expansion of the universe rapidly makes the KK field deviate from instability bands.

  REJ0503-289","We present the first evidence for the direct detection of nickel in the photosphere of the hot DO white dwarf REJ0503$-$289. While this element has been seen previously in the atmospheres of hot H-rich white dwarfs, this is one of the first similar discoveries in a He-rich object. Intriguingly, iron, which is observed to be more abundant than Ni in the hot DA stars, is not detected, the upper limit to its abundance (Fe/He$=10^{-6}$) implying a Fe/Ni ratio a factor 10 lower than seen in the H-rich objects (Ni/He$=10^{-5}$ for REJ0503$-$289). The abundance of nickel and various other elements heavier than He were determined from GHRS spectra. We used two completely independent sets of NLTE model atmospheres which both provide the same results. This not only reduces the possibility of systematic errors in our analysis but is also an important consistency check for both model atmosphere codes.   We have also developed a more objective method of determining $T_{\rm eff}$ and log g, from the He lines in the optical spectrum, in the form of a formal fitting of the line profiles to a grid of model spectra, an analogue of the standard procedure utilising the Balmer lines in DA white dwarfs. This gives the assigned uncertainties in $T_{\rm eff}$ and log g a firm statistical basis and allows us to demonstrate that inclusion of elements heavier than H, He and C in the spectral calculations, exclusively considered in most published optical analyses, yields a systematic downward shift in the measured value of $T_{\rm eff}$.",M.

In the limit of vanishing radion fluctuations, the effective action reduces to the Brans-Dicke gravity in accord with the results of Garriga and Tanaka: Brans-Dicke gravity with the corresponding Brans-Dicke parameter $0< \omega < \infty$ (for positive tension brane) and $-3/2< \omega <0$ (for negative tension brane).

The observed color gradients in elliptical galaxies at $z=0.1-1.0$ agree excellently with those predicted by the metallicity gradient, while they deviates significantly from those predicted by the age gradient even at $z \sim 0.3$ and the deviation is getting larger with increasing redshift.

Emission from SiO and H13CO+ is extended in the nucleus of NGC253. The bulk of the SiO/H13CO+ emission arises from a 600pcx250pc circumnuclear disk (CND) with a double ringed structure. The inner ring, of radius r=60pc, viewed edge-on along PA=51deg, hosts the nuclear starburst; the outer pseudo-ring opens out as a spiral-like arc up to r=300pc. The kinematics of the gaseous disk, characterized by strong non-circular motions, is interpreted in terms of the resonant response of the gas to the barred potential. The inner ring would correspond to the inner Inner Lindblad Resonance(iILR), whereas the outer region is linked to the onset of a trailing spiral wave across the outer ILR (oILR). Most notably, we report the detection of a molecular gas counterpart of the giant outflow of hot gas, previously seen in X-ray and optical lines, and tentatively identified as a dust chimney in the the 450mu continuum band.The SiO shows a high average fractional abundance in the CND of X(SiO)=1.5x10E-10.

X-rays currently yield cosmologically interesting results on the abundances, evolution and gas content of clusters of galaxies, on the clustering and evolution of active galaxies and on the X-ray Background. They are unlikely in the long term future to give the most precise values of the cosmological parameters, although in the short term the baryon fraction of clusters and the Sunyaev-Zeldovich effect will remain important determinants and checks for some parameters. X-rays will however continue to play an important role in studying the astrophysics of the formation and growth of black holes, galaxies, groups and clusters. It is possible that this role will be crucial, if winds from active galaxies are responsible for breaking the simple gravitational scaling laws for clusters.",A. C. Fabian,astro-ph,astro-ph
astro-ph/0001177v1,"Observational Limits on Terrestrial-Sized Inner Planets Around the CM
  Draconis System Using the Photometric Transit Method with a Matched-Filter
  Algorithm","A lightcurve of the eclipsing binary CM Draconis has been analyzed for the presence of transits of planets of size >= 2.5 Earth-radii (Re), with periods of 60 days or less, and in co-planar orbits around the binary system. About 400 million model lightcurves, representing transits from planets with periods ranging from 7 to 60 days, have been matched/correlated against these data. This process we call the ""transit detection algorithm"" or TDA. The resulting `transit-statistics' for each planet candidate allow the quantification of detection probabilities, and of false alarm rates.   Our current lightcurve of CM Dra has a coverage of 1014 hours with 26,043 individual points, at a photometric precision between 0.2% and 0.7%. Planets significantly larger then 3Re would constitute a `supra-noise' detection, and for periods of 60 days or less, they would have been detected with a probability of 90%. `Subnoise' detections of smaller planets are more constrained. For example, 2.5 Re planets with 10-day periods or less would have been detected with an 80% probability. The necessity for predicted observations is illustrated with the nine top planet candidates that emerged from our TDA analysis. They are the planet candidates with the highest transit-statistics from the 1994-1998 observing seasons and, for them, transits for the 1999 observing season were predicted. Of the seven candidates that were then observationally tested in 1999, all were ruled out except one, which needs further observational confirmation. We conclude that the photometric transit method is a viable way to search for relatively small, inner extrasolar planets with moderate-sized telescopes using CCD photometry with a matching-filter analysis.",Laurance R.

astro-ph/0001179v1,A deep ROSAT survey XV. the average QSO spectrum and its evolution,"Using a sample of 165 X-ray selected QSOs from seven deep ROSAT fields we investigate the X-ray spectral properties of an ``average''radio-quiet broad line QSO as a function of redshift. The QSO stacked spectra, in the observers 0.1-2 keV band, in five redshift bins over the range 0.1<z<3.2 apparently harden from an equivalent photon index of 2.6 at z=0.4 to ~2.1 at z=2.4 as seen in other QSO samples. In contrast, the spectra in the 0.5-2 keV band show no significant variation in spectral index with redshift. This suggests the presence of a spectral upturn at low energies (<0.5 keV). Indeed, while at high redshifts (z>1.0) the single power-law model gives an acceptable fit to the data over the full energy band, at lower redshifts the spectra need a second component at low energies, a `soft excess'. Inclusion of a simple model for the soft excess, i.e. a black-body component (kT~100 eV), results in a significant improvement to the model fit, and yields power-law slopes of 1.8-1.9, for all redshift bins. This power-law is not inconsistent, within the error bars, with those of nearby AGN in the 2-10 keV band, suggesting that the same intrinsic power-law slope may continue from 10 keV down to below 0.5 keV. We caution that there is a possibility that the spectral upturn observed may not represent a real physical component but could be due to co-adding spectra with a large dispersion in spectral indices. Regardless of the origin of the soft excess, the average QSO spectrum has important consequences for the origin of the X-ray background: the average spectra of the typical, faint, high redshift QSO are significantly steeper than the spectrum of the X-ray background extending the spectral paradox into the soft 0.1-2 keV X-ray band.",A.

hep-ph/0001083v2,A D-Brane Alternative to the MSSM,"The success of SU(5)-like gauge coupling unification boundary conditions $g_3^2=g_2^2=5/3 g_1^2$ has biased most attempts to embed the SM interactions into a unified structure. After discussing the limitations of the orthodox approach, we propose an alternative that appears to be quite naturally implied by recent developments based on D-brane physics. In this new alternative: 1) The gauge group, above a scale of order 1 TeV, is the minimal left-right symmetric extension $SU(3)\times SU(2)_L\times SU(2)_R\times U(1)_{B-L}$ of the SM; 2) Quarks, leptons and Higgs fields come in three generations; 3) Couplings unify at an intermediate string scale $M_s= 9\times 10^{11}$ GeV with boundary conditions $g_3^2=g_L^2=g_R^2=32/3 g_{B-L}^2$. This corresponds to the natural embedding of gauge interactions into D-branes and is different from the standard SO(10) embedding which corresponds to $k_{B-L}=8/3$. Unification only works in the case of three generations;   4) Proton stability is automatic due to the presence of $Z_2$ discrete R-parity and lepton parities. A specific Type IIB string orientifold model with the above characteristics is constructed. The existence of three generations is directly related to the existence of three complex extra dimensions.   In this model the string scale can be identified with the intermediate scale and SUSY is broken also at that scale due to the presence of anti-branes in the vacuum.   We discuss a number of phenomenological issues in this model including Yukawa couplings and a built-in axion solution to the strong-CP problem. The present framework could be tested by future accelerators by finding the left-right symmetric extension of the SM at a scale of order 1 TeV.",G. Aldazabal; L. E. Ibanez; F.

Calculations using the thermo-acoustic conversion model, agree well with the experimental data, as demonstrated by the specific variation of the excitation strengths with the absorbed energy, and with the traversing particles' track positions. For the first longitudinal mode of the cylindrical resonator we measured a conversion factor of 7.4 +- 1.4 nm/J, confirming the model value of 10 nm/J. Also, for the spherical resonator, we found the model values for the L=2 and L=1 mode amplitudes to be consistent with our measurement. We thus have confirmed the applicability of the model, and we note that calculations based on the model have shown that next generation resonant mass gravitational wave detectors can only be expected to reach their intended ultra high sensitivity if they will be shielded by an appreciable amount of rock, where a veto detector can reduce the background of remaining impinging cosmic rays effectively.",G.

This explains self-consistently both the lack of apparent radio emission, at least at frequencies higher than about 100 MHz, and the optical pulsations from the Geminga pulsar. From our model it follows that the synchrotron radiation is a maximum in the infrared band, which suggests that Geminga should also be a source of a pulsed infrared emission.",Janusz Gil; David Khechinashvili; George Melikidze,astro-ph,astro-ph

In fact, we give a modular invariant with three variables Z(z,\tau, u) in this case.

We discuss the properties of the output atoms in the quasi-steady-state where the population in the trap is not appreciably depleted. We show how the composition of the output beam, containing condensate and thermal component, may be controlled by changing the frequency of the output coupler. This composition determines the first and second order coherence of the output beam.

In view of the rapid accumulation of the experimental data on small-x charm structure function of the proton F2cc from HERA, we subject the issue of dominance of the rightmost hard BFKL pole exchange to further scrutiny. Based on CD BFKL-Regge factorization we report parameter-free predictions for the charm structure function F2cc and show that the background to the dominant rightmost hard BFKL exchange from subleading hard BFKL and soft-pomeron exchanges is negligible small from real photo-production to DIS at Q2 lsim 50-100 GeV2. The agreement with the experiment is good and lends strong support for the intercept of the rightmost hard BFKL pole DeltaPom=alphaPom-1=0.4 as found in 1994 in the color dipole approach.

In low energy effective theories of Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), one usually talks of the chiral transition for which a well defined order parameter exists. We investigate the dissociation of pions and kaons in a medium of hot quark matter decsribed by the Nambu - Jona Lasinio (NJL) model. The decay widths of pion and kaon are found to be large but finite at temperature much higher than the critical temperature for the chiral (or deconfinement) transition, the kaon decay width being much larger. Thus pions and even kaons (with a lower density compared to pions) may coexist with quarks and gluons at such high temperatures. On the basis of such premises, we investigate the process of hadronization in quark-gluon plasma with special emphasis on whether such processes shed any light on acceptable low energy effective theories of QCD.",Sibaji Raha,hep-ph,hep-ph

  relativistic electrons in Cassiopeia A","We consider the effect of energy dependent propagation of relativistic electrons in a spatially inhomogeneous medium in order to interpret the broad-band nonthermal radiation of the young supernova remnant (SNR) Cassiopeia A. A two-zone model is proposed that distinguishes between compact, bright steep-spectrum radio knots and the bright fragmented radio ring on the one hand, and the remainder of the shell - the diffuse `plateau' - on the other hand. In the framework of this model it is possible to explain the basic features of the spectral and temporal evolution of the synchrotron radiation of Cas A if one assumes that these compact structures correspond to sites of efficient electron acceleration producing hard spectra of accelerated particles with power-law indices ~2.2. The resulting energy distribution of radio electrons in these compact structures becomes significantly steeper than the electron production spectrum on timescales of the energy dependent escape of these electrons into the surrounding diffuse plateau region. We argue that the steepness, rather than the hardness, of the radio spectra of compact bright structures in clumpy sources can in general be considered as a typical signature of sites where strong electron acceleration has built up high gradients in the spatial distribution of radio electrons. Subsequent diffusive escape then modifies their energy distribution, leading to spatial variations of spectral indices within the radio source. Qualitative and quantitative interpretations of a number of observational data of Cas A are given. Predictions following from the model are discussed.",A. M. Atoyan; R. J. Tuffs; F. A. Aharonian; H.

These are the merging rates in compact groups, the properties of remnants of multiple mergers, and the evolution of disc galaxies surrounded by one or more satellites. The short dynamical times of compact groups make it difficult to understand why such groups are observed at all. N-body simulations have pointed out two possible classes of solutions to this problem. The first one proposes that there is on-going formation of compact groups, or that the longevity of the group is due to secondary infall. For the second class of solutions the longevity of compact groups is due either to their specific initial conditions, or to a massive common halo, encompassing the whole group. I discuss here these alternatives, together with their respective advantages and disadvantages. I then turn to the structure of remnants of multiple mergers and compare the results of N-body simulations with the properties of observed elliptical galaxies.

We investigate the mechanism for this transition from two-dimensional(2D) to three-dimensional(3D) growth. Atoms at the edge of 2D islands with the critical size s$_{c}$ become mobile as a result of strain and are promoted to the next level. Edge atoms of the resulting island remain highly strained and are promoted to the higher layers in quick succession. This process of depletion is rapid and occurs at a sharply defined island size.

astro-ph/0001186v1,On the gamma-ray fluxes expected from Cassiopeia A,"Based on the results of our previous study of the broad band synchrotron emission of Cas A in the framework of a spatial inhomogeneous model, we calculate the fluxes of gamma-radiation that can be expected from this supernova remnant in different energy bands. We show that at energies below 10 GeV gamma-ray fluxes detectable by forthcoming space-borne detectors should be produced due to bremsstrahlung of radio emitting electrons. We predict that the power-law index of the photon flux in the GeV region should be hard, close to the index ~2.2 expected for the acceleration spectrum of the electrons. Photon fluxes accessible to future ground-based gamma-ray detectors could also be expected at very high energies. The fluxes to be expected due to bremsstrahlung and inverse Compton radiation of relativistic electrons at TeV energies should be very steep, and strongly dependent on the characteristic magnetic fields in Cas A. We could expect also significant fluxes of pi^0 -decay gamma-rays produced by relativistic protons. These fluxes may extend with a hard spectrum beyond TeV energies as far as the protons would be accelerated to energies beyond 100 TeV. The hardness of the gamma-ray spectrum at TeV energies could in principle allow one to distinguish between electronic and hadronic origins of those gamma-rays. We discuss also other implications, such as relativistic particle content, or physical parameters in the source, that could be derived from future gamma-ray flux measurements in different energy bands.",A.

astro-ph/0001190v1,"The modulation effect for supersymmetric dark matter detection with
  asymmetric velocity dispersion","The detection of the theoretically expected dark matter is central to particle physics cosmology. Current fashionable supersymmetric models provide a natural dark matter candidate which is the lightest supersymmetric particle (LSP). Such models combined with fairly well understood physics like the quark substructure of the nucleon and the nuclear form factor and the spin response function of the nucleus, permit the evaluation of the event rate for LSP-nucleus elastic scattering. The thus obtained event rates are, however, very low or even undetectable. So it is imperative to exploit the modulation effect, i.e. the dependence of the event rate on the earth's annual motion. In this review we study such a modulation effect in directional and undirectional experiments. We calculate both the differential and the total rates using symmetric as well as asymmetric velocity distributions. We find that in the symmetric case the modulation amplitude is small, less than 0.07. There exist, however, regions of the phase space and experimental conditions such that the effect can become larger. The inclusion of asymmetry, with a realistic enhanced velocity dispersion in the galactocentric direction, yields the bonus of an enhanced modulation effect, with an amplitude which for certain parameters can become as large as 0.46.",J.

A massive observing campaign of five microlensing collaborations was unable to break this degeneracy photometrically in the case of the binary lensing event MACHO 98-SMC-1. We show that this degeneracy indeed causes the image centroids of the wide and close solutions to follow an extremely similar pattern of motion during the time when the source is in or near the caustic. Nevertheless, the two image centroids are displaced from one another and this displacement is detectable by observing the event at late times.

We argue, however, that their definition of the number density does not correspond to a quantity that could be measured in a realistic experiment. We consider a model where the heavy particles carry a conserved U(1) charge, and the light particles do not. The fluctuations of the net charge in a given volume then provide a measure of the total number of heavy particles in that same volume.

Extensive quantum Monte Carlo simulations of \chi(T) were carried out for both isolated and coupled two-leg ladders with spatially anisotropic intraladder exchange. Accurate fits to these and related literature QMC data were obtained. We have also calculated the one- and two-magnon dispersion relations and the dynamical spin structure factor for anisotropic isolated 2 x 12 ladders. The exchange constants in the two-leg ladder compound SrCu2O3 are estimated from LDA+U calculations. We report the detailed crystal structure of SrCu2O3 and of the three-leg ladder compound Sr2Cu3O5.

  double-layer quantum Hall system","We report on numerical studies of the energy spectrum and the localization properties in the double-layer quantum Hall system at $\nu = 1$. The Coulomb interaction is treated by the Hartree-Fock approximation, and the localization properties in the presence of disorder are studied by evaluating participation ratios for the Hartree-Fock eigenfunctions. We show that the extended states seem to exist only near each center of the two subbands split by the exchange-enhanced energy gap. It is also shown that the self-consistent orbitals whose energies are close to the Fermi energy appear to become extended together with the reduction in the energy gap as the layer separation increases. The collapse of the energy gap expected from our results is consistent with the incompressible-compressible transition observed in recent experiments, and the change of the localization properties near the Fermi energy can explain the disappearance of the quantum Hall effect for large layer separations very well.",Jun-ichiro Watanabe; Tatsuya Nakajima,cond-mat.mes-hall,cond-mat.mes-hall; cond-mat.dis-nn

Observation of a Josephson plasma resonance, below Tc (approx. 10 K), enables investigation of the vortex structure within the mixed state of this highly anisotropic, type-II, superconductor. Contrary to previous assumptions, frequency dependent studies (28 - 153 GHz) indicate that the squared plasma frequency depends exponentially on the magnetic field strength. Such behavior has been predicted for a weakly pinned quasi-two-dimensional vortex lattice [Bulaevskii et al. Phys. Rev. Lett. 74, 801 (1995)], but has not so far been observed experimentally.

cond-mat/0001139v2,Lattice parameters from direct-space images at two tilts,"Lattices in three dimensions are oft studied from the ``reciprocal space'' perspective of diffraction. Today, the full lattice of a crystal can often be inferred from direct-space information about three sets of non-parallel lattice planes. Such data can come from electron-phase or Z contrast images taken at two tilts, provided that one image shows two non-parallel lattice periodicities, and the other shows a periodicity not coplanar with the first two. We outline here protocols for measuring the 3D parameters of cubic lattice types in this way. For randomly-oriented nanocrystals with cell side greater than twice the continuous transfer limit, orthogonal +/-15 deg and +/-10 deg tilt ranges might allow one to measure 3D parameters of all such lattice types in a specimen from only two well-chosen images. The strategy is illustrated by measuring the lattice parameters of a 10 nm WC_{1-x} crystal in a plasma-enhanced chemical-vapor deposited thin film.",W. Qin; P.

This coupling provides an explanation of recently observed subgap resonances in the $I_{dc}$-$V_{dc}$- curve of anisotropic cuprate superconductors forming a stack of short Josephson junctions. Due to the finite dispersion these resonances can appear at van-Hove-singularities of both optical and acoustical phonon branches, explaining low-voltage structures in the I-V-characteristic, which are not understood in phonon models without dispersion.

The composite spectra do not have any features attributable to the brightest stars in the central cluster, i.e.\ after background subtraction, W$_{\rm ^{12}CO(2-0)}$~$<$~2~\AA. This stringent limit leads us to conclude that the majority, if not all, of the stars are hotter than typical red giants. Coupled with previously reported photometry, we conclude that the sources are likely OB main sequence stars. In addition, the continuum slope in the composite spectrum is bluer than that of a red giant and is similar to that of the nearby hot star, IRS16NW. It is unlikely that they are late-type giants stripped of their outer envelopes because such sources would be much fainter than those observed. Given their inferred youth ($\tau_{\rm age}$~$<$~20~\Myr), we suggest the possibility that the stars have formed within 0.1 pc of the supermassive black hole.

  algebraically special frequency","We study the Regge-Wheeler and Zerilli equations (RWE and ZE) at the `algebraically special frequency' $\Omega$, where these equations admit an exact solution (elaborated here), generating the SUSY relationship between them. The physical significance of the SUSY generator and of the solutions at $\Omega$ in general is elucidated as follows. The RWE has no (quasinormal or total-transmission) modes at all; however, $\Omega$ is nonetheless `special' in that (a) for the outgoing wave into the horizon one has a `miraculous' cancellation of a divergence expected due to the exponential potential tail, and (b) the branch-cut discontinuity at $\omega=\Omega$ vanishes in the outgoing wave to infinity. Moreover, (a) and (b) are related. For the ZE, its only mode is the-inverse-SUSY generator, which is at the same time a quasinormal mode_and_ a total-transmission mode propagating to infinity. The subtlety of these findings (of general relevance for future study of the equations on or near the negative imaginary $\omega$-axis) may help explain why the situation has sometimes been controversial. For finite black-hole rotation, the algebraically special modes are shown to be totally transmitting, and the implied singular nature of the Schwarzschild limit is clarified.

We define a notion of twistors on these spaces, which are hypersurfaces in a vector space that transform linearly under the isometry group of the coset. By associating the points of the coset space with these hypersurfaces, and the internal coordinates of these hypersurfaces with momenta, it is possible to construct manifestly symmetric actions with leading quadratic terms. We give a general algorithm and work out the case of a particle on AdS_p explicitly.

  between cluster populations and host galaxy properties","We present an analysis of correlations between integrated properties of galaxies and their populations of young massive star clusters. Data for 21 nearby galaxies presented by Larsen & Richtler (1999) are used together with literature data for 10 additional galaxies, spanning a range in specific U-band luminosity T_L(U) from 0 to 15. We find that T_L(U) correlates with several observable host galaxy parameters, in particular the ratio of Far-Infrared (FIR) to B-band flux and the optical surface brightness. Taking the FIR luminosity as an indicator of the star formation rate (SFR), it is found that T_L(U) correlates very well with the SFR per unit area. A similar correlation is seen between T_L(U) and the atomic hydrogen surface density. The cluster formation efficiency seems to depend on the SFR in a continuous way, rather than being related to any particularly violent mode of star formation. We discuss fundamental features of possible scenarios for cluster formation. One possibility is that the correlation between T_L(U) and SFR is due to a common controlling parameter, most probably the density of the ISM. Another scenario conceives a high T_L(U) as resulting from the energy input from many massive stars in case of a high SFR.",S. S. Larsen; T. Richtler,astro-ph,astro-ph

When $\epsilon > 1$, where $\epsilon c$ is the caustic speed, the usual formalism for calculating the lens magnification breaks down. We develop a new formalism that makes use of the gravitational analog of the Li\'enard-Wiechert potential. We find that as the binary speeds up, the caustics undergo several related changes: First, their position in space drifts. Second, they rotate about their own axes so that they no longer have a cusp facing the binary center of mass. Third, they grow larger and dramatically so for $\epsilon >> 1$. Fourth, they grow weaker roughly in proportion to their increasing size.

For the exchange-correlation kernela, three adiabatic approximations were tested: The local density approximation, exact exchange, and SIC-LDA.

The K-band image shows that this system consists of three components, all of which are likely to be the gravitationally lensed images of the same background object, and the 12.5 micron image shows a morphology consistent with such an image configuration. Our lens model suggests that the magnification factor is ~100 from the restframe UV to mid-IR, where most of the luminosity is released. The intrinsic bolometric luminosity and IR luminosity of APM08279+5255 are estimated to be 5x10^{13} Lsun and 1x10^{13} Lsun, respectively. This indicates that APM 08279+5255 is intriniscally luminous, but it is not the most luminous object known.

This result implies that any single Higgs boson will be detectable at an e^+e^- collider if the Z+Higgs, $b\anti b+$Higgs {\it and} $t\anti t+$Higgs production channels are all kinematically accessible {\it and} if the integrated luminosity is sufficient. We explore, as a function of Higgs mass, the luminosity required to guarantee Higgs boson detection, and find that for moderate $\tan\beta$ values the needed luminosity is unlikely to be available for all possible mixing scenarios.

However, Rubakov and Sibiryakov suggest that the Hawking Moss solution is not a solution for the false vacuum decay process since it does not satisfy the boundary condition. Hence, we have reconsidered the arguments for the defect of the simple polynomial model. We find the valley bounce belonging to a valley line in the functional space represents the decay process instead of the Hawking Moss solution. The point is that the valley bounce gives the appropriate initial condition for the inflation.

The evanescent wave is characterized by a forerunner (transient) related to the precise way the source is switched on. It is followed by an asymptotic, monochromatic wave which at long times reveals the oscillation frequency of the source. For a source with a sharp onset the forerunner is exponentially larger than the monochromatic solution and a transition from the transient regime to the asymtotic regime occurs only at asymptotically large times. In this case, the traversal time for tunneling plays already a role only in the transient regime. To enhance the monochromatic solution compared to the forerunner we investigate (a) frequency band limited sources and (b) the short time Fourier analysis (the spectrogram) corresponding to a detector which is frequency band limited. Neither of these two methods leads to a precise determination of the traversal time. However, if they are limited to determine the traversal time only with a precision of the traversal time itself both methods are successful: In this case the transient behavior of the evanescent waves is at a time of the order of the traversal time followed by a monochromatic wave which reveals the frequency of the source.",J.

astro-ph/0001203v1,"Disc instability models for X-ray transients: evidence for evaporation
  and low alpha-viscosity ?","We construct time-dependent models of accretion discs around black holes and neutron stars. We investigate the effect of evaporating the disc inner regions during quiescence on the predictions of the Disc Instability Model (DIM) for these systems. We do not include irradiation of the disc in the models.   Removing the inner, most unstable parts of the accretion disc increases the predicted recurrence times. However, DIMs with values of the viscosity parameter alpha_hot ~ 0.1 and alpha_cold ~ 0.02 (typical of applications of the DIM to standard dwarf nova outbursts) fail to reproduce the long recurrence times of SXTs (unless we resort to fine-tuning of the parameters) independent of the evaporation strength. We show that models with evaporation and a smaller value of alpha_cold (~ 0.005) do reproduce the long recurrence times and the accretion rates at the level of the Eddington rate observed in outburst. The large difference between the values of alpha_hot and alpha_cold, if confirmed when disc irradiation is included, suggests that several viscosity mechanisms operate in these accretion discs.   For some choices of parameters our models predict reflares during the decline from outburst. They are a physical property of the model and result from a heating front forming in the wake of an initial cooling front and subsequent, multiple front reflections. The reflares disappear in low-alpha models where front reflection can not occur.",Kristen Menou; Jean-Marie Hameury; Jean-Pierre Lasota; Ramesh Narayan,astro-ph,astro-ph
astro-ph/0001204v1,A large high-energy gamma-ray flare from the blazar 3C 273,"The Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory (CGRO) experiments EGRET and COMPTEL observed the Virgo sky region continuously for 7 weeks between December 10, 1996 and January 28, 1997. The prominent quasar 3C~273 was found to be the brightest source in gamma-rays and was significantly detected by EGRET and COMPTEL. The EGRET experiment observed a time-variable flux at energies above 100 MeV, which reached in a 2-week flaring period (December 30, 1996 to January 14, 1997) its highest flux level observed during the CGRO-era. COMPTEL, however, does not observe obvious time variability at energies below ~30 MeV contemporaneous to EGRET. In particular, no flare was observed, indicating that this outburst is solely a high-energy (>100 MeV) phenomenon. The energy spectrum between 3 MeV and 10 GeV is well represented by a simple power-law model. Below 3 MeV a spectral turnover is indicated. Performing spectral analysis for different time periods, we found evidence for a spectral hardening during the flaring period, which is consistent with the flare occurring mainly at the higher energies and with its absence at COMPTEL energies of a few MeV. This may be interpreted as an indication that the emission in the EGRET energy range is dominated by a different radiation mechanism than the MeV emission. We argue that the most likely mechanism for the high-energy flare is inverse-Compton scattering of reprocessed accretion-disk radiation.",W. Collmar; O. Reimer; K. Bennett; H. Bloemen; W. Hermsen; G.

astro-ph/0001206v1,"Extended Gas in Seyfert Galaxies: Near-Infrared Observations of 15
  Active Nuclei","Results from an analysis of low resolution (R~250) near-IR long-slit spectra covering simultaneously the I, J, H, and K bands, for a sample of 15 Seyfert galaxies and the N5253 starburst nucleus, are presented. The Seyfert galaxies were selected as presenting `linear' or cone-like high excitation emission line in the optical, most probably due to the collimation of the central source's radiation by a dusty molecular torus. Our goal was to look for signatures of this torus, and to investigate the gaseous distribution, excitation and reddening. The IR emission lines are spatially extended in most cases, and we have used the [FeII]/Pa(beta) ratio as a measure of the gaseous excitation in Mrk573, N1386, and N7582. Values for this ratio between 1.5 and 6 are found, suggesting excitation of [FeII] by X-rays or shock waves in some regions. Nuclear Pa(beta) in N1365, and possibly nuclear Br(gama) in Mrk573, are broad.   From analysis of the spatial distribution of the continuum (J-H) and (H-K) colours derived from our spectra, we find redder colours for the nucleus than the nearby bulge in most of the Seyfert 2s observed. Comparison with models including emission from dust and stars shows that hot (T~1000 K) dust emission dominates the nuclear continuum in N1365, N2110, N3281, N7582, and ESO362-G18. In N1386, N5643, and N5728 the main contributor is the underlying stellar population, combined with some foreground reddening and/or cool dust emission. In a few cases, the (J-H) colours on opposite sides of the nucleus differ by 0.3-0.8 mag, an effect that we interpret as partly due to differences in the local stellar population, and possibly extinction gradients.",Claudia Winge; Thaisa Storchi-Bergmann; Martin J.

astro-ph/0001207v2,The redshift evolution of bias and baryonic matter distribution,"We study the distribution of baryonic and luminous matter within the framework of a hierarchical scenario. Using an analytical model for structure formation which has already been checked against observations for galaxies, Lyman-$\alpha$ clouds, clusters and reionization processes, we present its predictions for the bias of these objects. We describe its dependence on the luminosity (for galaxies or quasars) or the column density (for Lyman-$\alpha$ absorbers) of the considered objects. We also study its redshift evolution, which can exhibit an intricate behaviour. These astrophysical objects do not trace the dark matter density field, the Lyman-$\alpha$ forest clouds being undercorrelated and the bright galaxies overcorrelated, while the intermediate class of Lyman-limit systems is seen to sample the matter field quite well.   We also present the distribution of baryonic matter over these various objects. We show that light does not trace baryonic mass, since bright galaxies which contain most of the stars only form a small fraction of the mass associated with virialized and cooled halos. We consider two cosmologies: a critical density universe and an open universe. In both cases, our results agree with observations and show that hierarchical scenarios provide a good model for structure formation and can describe a wide range of objects which spans at least the seven orders of magnitude in mass for which data exist. More detailed observations, in particular of the clustering evolution of galaxies, will constrain the astrophysical models involved.",P. Valageas; J. Silk; R. Schaeffer,astro-ph,astro-ph

Fitting a symmetric Lorentzian profile to the peaks therefore produces a shift in frequency of the modes. Accurate determination of low-frequency modes is essential to infer the structure of the solar core by inversion of the mode frequencies. In this paper we investigate how the changes in frequencies of low-degree modes obtained by fitting symmetric and asymmetric peak profiles change the inferred properties of the solar core. We use data obtained by the Global Oscillations at Low Frequencies (GOLF) project on board the SoHO spacecraft. Two different solar models and inversion procedures are used to invert the data to determine the sound speed in the solar core. We find that for a given set of modes no significant difference in the inferred sound-speed results from taking asymmetry into account when fitting the low-degree modes.",S. Basu; S. Turck-Chieze; G.

astro-ph/0001209v1,A ROSAT HRI survey of bright nearby galaxies,"We use the extensive public archive of ROSAT High Resolution Imager (HRI) observations to carry out a statistical investigation of the X-ray properties of nearby galaxies. Specifically we focus on the sample of 486 bright (B_T < 12.5) northern galaxies studied by Ho, Filippenko and Sargent (HFS) in the context of their exploration of the optical spectroscopic properties of nearby galactic nuclei. Over 20% of HFS galaxies are encompassed in ROSAT HRI fields of reasonable (> 10ks) exposure. The X-ray sources detected within the optical extent of each galaxy are categorised as either nuclear or non-nuclear depending on whether the source is positioned within or outside of a 25 arcsecond radius circle centred on the optical nucleus. A nuclear X-ray source is detected in over 70% of the galaxies harbouring either a Seyfert or LINER nucleus compared to a detection rate of only ~40% in less active systems. The correlation of the H alpha luminosity with nuclear X-ray luminosity previously observed in QSOs and bright Seyfert 1 galaxies appears to extend down into the regime of ultra-low luminosity (L(x)~10^38 - 10^40 erg/s) active galactic nuclei (AGN). The inferred accretion rates for this sample of low-luminosity AGN are significantly sub-Eddington. In total 142 non-nuclear sources were detected. In combination with published data for M31 this leads to a luminosity distribution (normalised to an optical blue luminosity of L(B) = 10^10 L(solar)) for the discrete X-ray source population in spiral galaxies of the form dN/dL38 = 1.0 +/- 0.2 L38^-1.8, where L38 is the X-ray luminosity in units of 10^38 erg/s. The implied L(x)/L(B) ratio is ~1.1 x 10^39 erg/s/(10^10 L(solar)). The nature of the substantial number of ``super-luminous'' non-nuclear objects detected in the survey is discussed.",T. P.

astro-ph/0001211v1,"The 1996 outburst of GRO J1655-40: disc irradiation and enhanced mass
  transfer","We show that the 1996 outburst of the X-ray binary transient system GRO J1655-40 can be explained by the standard dwarf-nova type disc instability, followed by an episode of enhanced mass transfer from the secondary if the mass transfer rate in GRO J1655-40 is within a factor < 10 of the stability limit. We argue that irradiation of the secondary during the onset of the outburst driven by the thermal instability in the outer disc can increase the mass transfer rate above the minimum value required for stable accretion. This will then produce the period of near-constant X-ray emission seen in this system. This scenario can also explain the observed anti-correlation between the optical and X-ray fluxes. It is generally accepted that optical emission in low-mass X-ray binaries is produced by irradiation of the outer disc by X-rays. There is also strong circumstantial evidence that in order for the outer disc to see the irradiating flux, it must be warped. Depending on the warp propagation mechanism, either a burst of mass from the secondary or viscous decay are likely to decrease the degree of warping, thereby causing the decrease in the observed optical flux while the X-ray flux remains constant or even increases, exactly as observed in GRO J1655-40. Finally, the decrease of the disc warping and, therefore, irradiation will cause the disc to become unstable once again, terminating the outburst.",A. A. Esin; J. -P. Lasota; R. I.

astro-ph/0001205v1,Regular magnetic fields in the dwarf irregular galaxy NGC 4449,"We present a high-resolution VLA study of the total power and polarized radio continuum emission at 8.46 and 4.86 GHz of the irregular galaxy NGC 4449, known for its weak rotation and non-systematic gas motions. We found strong galaxy-scale regular magnetic fields, which is surprising because of a lack of ordered rotation required for the dynamo action. The strength of the regular field reaches 8 $\mu$G and that of the total field 14 $\mu$G, comparable to that of the total magnetic field strength in radio-bright spirals. The magnetic vectors in NGC 4449 form radial ``fans'' in the central region and fragments of a spiral pattern in the galaxy's outskirts. These structures are associated with large regions of systematic Faraday rotation, implying genuine galaxy-scale magnetic fields rather than random ones compressed and stretched by gas flows. The observed pattern of polarization B-vectors is similar to dynamo-type fields in normal spirals. Nonstandard, fast dynamo concepts are required to explain the observed field strengths, though it is unknown what kind of magnetic field geometry can be produced in slowly and chaotically rotating objects. The so far neglected role of magnetic fields for the dynamics and star formation in dwarf irregulars also needs to be revised.",K. T. Chyzy; R. Beck; S. Kohle; U. Klein; M. Urbanik,astro-ph,astro-ph
astro-ph/0001210v1,The stellar populations of early-type galaxies in the Fornax cluster,"We have measured central line strengths for a magnitude-limited sample of early-type galaxies in the Fornax cluster, comprising 11 elliptical (E) and 11 lenticular (S0) galaxies, more luminous than MB=-17. When compared with single-burst stellar population models we find that the centres of Fornax ellipticals follow a locus of fixed age and have metallicities varying roughly from half solar to two times solar. The centres of (lower luminosity) lenticular galaxies, however, exhibit a substantial spread to younger luminosity-weighted ages indicating a more extended star formation history. Galaxies with old stellar populations show tight scaling relations between metal-line indices and the central velocity dispersion. Remarkably also the Fe-lines are well correlated with sigma. Our detailed analysis of the stellar populations suggests that these scaling relations are driven mostly by metallicity. Galaxies with a young stellar component do generally deviate from the main relation. In particular the lower luminosity S0s show a large spread. Furthermore we find that elliptical galaxies and the bulge of one bright S0 are overabundant in magnesium, where the most luminous galaxies show the strongest overabundances. The stellar populations of young and faint S0s are consistent with solar abundance ratios or a weak Mg underabundance. (abriged)",Harald Kuntschner,astro-ph,astro-ph

Thus, WD1704+481 is the first known triple degenerate star. From radial velocity measurements of the close binary we find an orbital period of 0.1448d, a mass ratio, q=Mbright/Mfaint of q=0.70+-0.03 and a difference in the gravitational redshifts of 11.5+-2.3km/s. The masses of the close pair of white dwarfs predicted by the mass ratio and gravitational redshift difference combined with theoretical cooling curves are 0.39+-0.05 solar mass and 0.56+-0.07 solar masses.

gr-qc/0001036v7,Towards a Deeper Understanding of General Relativity,"Standard treatments of general relativity accept the gravitational slowing of clocks as a primary phenomenon, requiring no further analysis as to cause. Rejecting this attitude, I argue that one or more of the fundamental ""constants"" governing the quantum mechanics of atoms must depend upon position in a gravitational field. A simple relationship governing the possible dependencies of e, h, c and m is deduced, and arguments in favor of the choice of the electron rest mass, m, are presented. The reduction of rest mass is thus taken to be the sole cause of clock slowing. Importantly, this dependency implies another effect, heretofore unsuspected, namely, the gravitational elongation of measuring rods. An alternate (""telemetric"") system of measurement is introduced, leading to a metric that is conformally related to the usual proper metric. In terms of the new system, many otherwise puzzling phenomena may be simply understood. In particular,the geometry of the Schwarzschild space as described by the telemetric system differs profoundly from that described by proper measurments, leading to a very different understanding of the structure of black holes. The theory is extended to cosmology,leading to a remarkable alternate view of the structure and history of the universe.",John E. Heighway,gr-qc,gr-qc

physics/0001026v1,Innovators and Interpreters: The Historic Role of Women in Science,"Until this century, the number of working female scientists has been indeterminate. Prevailing wisdom indicates that women, historically, have not excelled in the mathematics and sciences, for various reasons. These range from societal pressures to marry and bear children, to a lack of systematic scientific education for females, to the lack of opportunity in institutions and industry. Women, until comparatively recently, were not in control of their own financial lives, and were therefore dependent upon the goodwill of a husband, father or brother, should they attempt to enter academic life. Many times, their accomplishments, and the accomplishments of these collaborating relatives, become so merged as to become indistinguishable. Nevertheless, with all these factors working against them, history records an occasional bright star. Their diaries, memoirs and correspondence detail both the similarities and the differences between their roles and the roles of modern female scientists, in their own minds, and in the estimation of those closest to them. There exists, in science, a dichotomy between the desire to understand one's universe, and the desire to change the understanding of others.

Furthermore, a full numerical calculation is given for the radiative tail, corresponding with photon emission processes, where the photon energy is not very small compared with the lepton momenta. We compare our results with existing works on elastic electron-proton scattering, and show for the $e p \to e p \gamma$ reaction how the observables are modified due to these first order QED radiative corrections. We show results for both unpolarized and polarized observables of the virtual Compton scattering in the low energy region (where one is sensitive to the generalized polarizabilities of the nucleon), as well as for the deeply virtual Compton scattering.",M.

Emission from the pure rotational lines of H_2, from ro-vibrational transitions of CO, from PAHs, from H I recombination lines and from the infrared fine structure lines of [Fe II], [Si II], [S I], [O I], [O III] and [C II] was detected. These emission lines arise in the combination of a low-density (approx 10^2 cm^-3) H II region with a clumpy PDR in the case of BD+40 4124. The lower transitions of the infrared H I lines observed in BD+40 4124 are optically thick; most likely they arise in either a dense wind or a circumstellar disk. This same region is also responsible for the optical H I lines and the radio continuum emission. In the lines of sight towards LkHalpha 224 and LkHalpha 225, the observed emission lines arise in a non-dissociative shock produced by a slow (approx 20 km/s) outflow arising from LkHalpha 225. Toward LkHalpha 225 we also observe a dissociative shock, presumably located closer to the outflow source than the non-dissociative shock. In the line of sight towards LkHalpha 225 we observed absorption features due to solid water ice and amorphous silicates, and due to gas-phase H_2O, CO and CO_2. No solid CO_2 was detected towards LkHalpha 225, making this the first line of sight where the bulk of the CO_2 is in the gas-phase.",M. E. van den Ancker; P. R. Wesselius; A. G. G. M.

  2+4-armed patterns","We investigate the possibility of describing the spiral pattern of the Milky Way in terms of a model of superposition 2- and 4-armed wave harmonics (the simplest description, besides pure modes). Two complementary methods are used: a study of stellar kinematics, and direct tracing of positions of spiral arms. In the first method, the parameters of the galactic rotation curve and the free parameters of the spiral density waves were obtained from Cepheid kinematics, under different assumptions. To turn visible the structure corresponding to these models, we computed the evolution of an ensemble of N-particles, simulating the ISM clouds, in the perturbed galactic gravitational field. In the second method, we present a new analysis of the longitude-velocity (l-v) diagram of the sample of galactic HII regions, converting positions of spiral arms in the galactic plane into locii of these arms in the l-v diagram. Both methods indicate that the ``self-sustained'' model, in which the 2-armed and 4-armed mode have different pitch angles (6 arcdeg and 12 arcdeg, respectively) is a good description of the disk structure. An important conclusion is that the Sun happens to be practically at the corotation circle. As an additional result of our study, we propose an independent test for localization of the corotation circle in a spiral galaxy: a gap in the radial distribution of interstellar gas has to be observed in the corotation region.",J.

The physics motivation for photon colliders is quite clear. The proof of its technical feasibility and the search for the best solutions is of first priority now. A key element of a photon collider is a laser with high peak power and repetition rate. One very promising way to overcome this problem is the optical cavity approach which is discussed in this paper. A very high gamma-gamma luminosity could be achieved by further decreasing the beam emittances. This will be very challenging. One possible way is laser cooling of electron beams. This method is discussed in my second talk at this symposium. The solution to the first problem is vital for photon colliders and provides an interesting physics program.

As a result, an additional term, coming from a careful consideration of entropic contributions, is added to the equation. This term heals all the recently reported generic infrared singularities.   The emerging equation is then identical to that describing randomly driven diffusive systems. This fact confirms our claim that the infinite driving limit is singular, and that the main relevant ingredient determining the critical behavior of the DLG in this limit is the anisotropy and not the presence of a current. Different aspects of our picture are discussed, and it is concluded that it constitutes a very plausible scenario to rationalize the critical behavior of the DLG and variants of it.",P. L.

The model applies to both for adhesion of two flexible membranes and to adhesion of one flexible membrane onto a second membrane supported on a solid substrate. We mainly consider the case where the sticker molecules form bridges and adhere directly to both membranes. The calculated mean-field phase diagrams show an upward shift of the transition temperature indicating that the lateral phase separation in the membrane is enhanced due to the coupling effect. Hence the possibility of adhesion-induced lateral phase separation is predicted. For a particular choice of the parameters, the model exhibits a tricritical behavior. We also discuss the non-monotonous shape of the inter-membrane distance occurring when the lateral phase separation takes place. The inter-membrane distance relaxes to the bulk values with two symmetric overshoots.

To adjust SFR values, obtained from different indicators, we considered the slope $\alpha$ and/or upper mass limit $M_{up}$ of Initial Mass Function (IMF) as free parameters. The best agreement between these indicators reaches for $M_{up} \approx 60 - 100 ~M_{\odot}$ and $\alpha \approx -3.1 $ in the high mass end of IMF ($M > 10 ~M_{\odot}$). Parallel with SFR we also estimated FIR excess $X_{FIR}$ defined as a fraction of the observed FIR which is not related to young massive stars directly. $X_{FIR}$ is found to be well correlated with types of spiral galaxies and their colors (B-V): the redder a galaxy the higher is its FIR excess.

We focus on the regime where the shear stress is smaller than its critical value, where there is a finite energy barrier for the dislocation to hop one lattice spacing. In this regime motion of the dislocation will occur as single hops through thermal activation over the barrier. Accurate knowledge of the barrier height is crucial for obtaining the rates of such processes.

The ENs are simple analog circuits which integrate four dimensional differential equations representing fast and slow subcellular mechanisms that produce the characteristic regular/chaotic spiking-bursting behavior of these cells. In this paper we study their dynamical behavior as we couple them in the same configurations as we have done for their counterpart biological neurons. The interconnections we use for these neural oscillators are both direct electrical connections and excitatory and inhibitory chemical connections: each realized by analog circuitry and suggested by biological examples. We provide here quantitative evidence that the ENs and the biological neurons behave similarly when coupled in the same manner. They each display well defined bifurcations in their mutual synchronization and regularization.

The massless scalar excitations are combined with the longitudinal gluons leading to the Meissner effect in the CFL phase. The mass of the composite vector excitations is close to twice the gap in weak coupling, but goes asymptotically to zero with increasing coupling thereby realizing Georgi's vector limit in cold and dense matter. We discuss the possible mixing of the composite scalar and vector excitations with the gluons, their possible coupling to the modified photons and their decay into light pseudoscalars in the CFL phase.

Uniform stripe phases are shown to be unstable to the formation of modulations along the stripes, so that within the Hartree-Fock approximation the groundstate is a stripe crystal. Such crystalline states are generically gapped at any finite wavevector; however, in the quantum Hall system the interactions of modulations among different stripes is found to be remarkably weak, leading to an infinite collection of collective modes with immeasurably small gaps. The resulting long wavelength behavior is derivable from an elastic theory for smectic liquid crystals. Collective modes for the phonon branch are computed throughout the Brillouin zone, as are spin wave and magnetoplasmon modes.

A well-known limitation of dependence analysis is that it examines only the memory locations read and written by a statement, and does not assume any particular interpretation for the operations in that statement. Exploiting the semantics of these operations enables a wider set of transformations to be used, and is critical for optimizing important codes such as LU factorization with pivoting.   Symbolic execution of programs enables the exploitation of such semantic properties, but it is intractable for all but the simplest programs. In this paper, we propose a new form of symbolic analysis for use in restructuring compilers. Fractal symbolic analysis compares a program and its transformed version by repeatedly simplifying these programs until symbolic analysis becomes tractable, ensuring that equality of simplified programs is sufficient to guarantee equality of the original programs.

The infrared-active phonon frequencies and dielectric constants are obtained by oscillator fitting procedure of the reflectivity data measured at room temperature. The Raman scattering spectra are measured at room temperature and at T=10 K in all nonequivalent polarized configurations. The assignment of the phonons is done by comparing the infrared and Raman spectra of LiV2O5 and NaV2O5.

This study is motivated by the discovery of the superstrongly magnetized neutron stars, i.e., magnetar. We derive the contributions of the magnetic fields to the accumulated cycles in gravitational waves as $N_{mag} \sim 6 \times 10^{-3} (H/10^{16}{\rm G})^{2}$, where $H$ denotes the strength of the polar magnetic fields of each neutron star in the binary system. It is found that the effects of the magnetic fields will be negligible for the detection and the parameter estimation of gravitational waves, if the upper limit for magnetic fields of neutron stars are less than $\sim 10^{16}$G, which is the maximum magnetic field observed in the soft gamma repeaters and the anomalous X-ray pulsars up to date.

Such an observation could be used to distinguish the new physics effects from different mode ls.

astro-ph/0001219v2,"Disc galaxy evolution models in a hierarchical formation scenario:
  structure and dynamics","We predict the structure and dynamics of disc galaxies using galaxy evolution models within a hierarchical formation scenario The halo mass aggregation histories, for a Lambda CDM model, were generated and used to calculate the virialization of dark matter (DM) haloes. A diversity of halo density profiles were obtained, the most typical one being close to the NFW profile. We modeled the formation of discs in centrifugal equilibrium within the evolving DM haloes using gas accretion rates proportional to the halo mass aggregation rates, and assuming detailed angular momentum conservation. We calculated the gravitational interactions between halo and disc, and the hydrodynamics, star formation, and evolution of the galaxy discs. We found that the slope and zero-point of the infrared Tully-Fisher relations (TFR) may be explained as a direct consequence of the cosmological initial conditions. This relation is almost independent of the assumed disc mass fraction. The rms scatter of the TFR originates mainly from the scatter in the DM halo structure and, to a minor extension, from the dispersion of the primordial spin parameter. The scatter obtained does not disagree with the observational estimates. Our models allow us to understand why the residuals of the TFR do not correlate significantly with disc size or surface brightness (SB), and why low and high SB galaxies have the same TFR. The correlations between gas fraction and SB, and between scale length and V_max agree with those observed. The discs present nearly exponential SB distributions. The shape of the rotation curves changes with the SB and is nearly flat for most cases. The rotation curve decompositions show a dominance of DM down to very small radii.

We associate this feature, a bifurcation of the observed elemental ratios into two branches in the Mg abundance interval -2.7 < [Mg/H] < -2.3, with two distinct processes. The first branch, which we call the ``y''-branch, is associated with the production of Ba and Mg from individual massive supernovae. We conclude that SNe II with Mms = 20 Msun are the dominant source of r-process nucleosynthesis in the early Galaxy. An SN-induced chemical evolution model with this Mms-dependent Ba yield creates the y-branch, reflecting the different nucleosynthesis yields of [Ba/Mg] for each SN II with Mms > 20 Msun. The second branch, which we call the ``i''-branch, is associated with the elemental abundance ratios of stars which were formed in the dense shells of the interstellar medium swept up by SNe II with Mms < 20 Msun that do not synthesize r-process elements, and applies to stars with observed Mg abundances in the range [Mg/H] < -2.7. The Ba abundances in these stars reflect those of the interstellar gas at the (later) time of their formation. The existence of a [Ba/Mg] i-branch strongly suggests that SNe II which are associated with stars of progenitor mass Mms < 20 Msun are infertile sources for the production of r-process elements. We predict the existence of this i-branch for other r-process elements, such as europium (Eu), to the extent that their production site is in common with Ba.",Takuji Tsujimoto; Toshikazu Shigeyama; Yuzuru Yoshii,astro-ph,astro-ph

The form of Cornwall-Jackiw-Tomboulis effective potential is modified by the use of the Schwinger-Dyson equation for generally nonzero current quark mass. We then calculate the effective potential at finite T and/or $\mu$ and investigate the phase structure in the chiral limit. We have a second-order phase transition at $T_c=129$ MeV for $\mu=0$ and a first-order one at $\mu_c=422$ MeV for T=0. A tricritical point in the T-$\mu$ plane is found at T=107 MeV, $\mu=210$ MeV.

We show that the Bethe ansatz solutions with normalizable wave functions cannot be the eigenstates of $T$ and $V$ with quantum number $(\Omega,\Upsilon)=(\pm 1,\mp 1)$ where $\Upsilon$ is the eigenvalue of $V$. Therefore the Bethe ansatz wave functions should be singular for nondegenerate eigenstates of the Hamiltonian with quantum number $(\Omega,\Upsilon)=(\pm 1,\mp 1)$.

  spin-phonon interaction and structural distortion","Optical properties of single-crystal monoclinic CuO in the range 70 - 6000 \cm were studied at temperatures from 7 to 300 K. Normal reflection spectra were obtained from the (001) and (010) crystal faces thus giving for the first time separate data for the $A_{u}$ and $B_{u}$ phonon modes excited in the purely transverse way (TO modes). Mode parameters, including polarizations of the $B_{u}$ modes not determined by the crystal symmetry, were extracted by the dispersion analysis of reflectivity curves as a function of temperature. Spectra of all the components of the optical conductivity tensor were obtained using the Kramers-Kronig method recently extended to the case of the low-symmetry crystals. The number of strong phonon modes is in agreement with the factor-group analysis for the crystal structure, currently accepted for the CuO. However, several ""extra"" modes of minor intensity are detected. Comparison of frequencies of ""extra"" modes with the available phonon dispersion curves points to possible ""diagonal"" doubling of the unit cell \{{\bf a}, {\bf b}, {\bf c}\} $\to$ \{{\bf a}+{\bf c}, {\bf b}, {\bf a}-{\bf c}\} and formation of the superlattice. The previously reported softening of the $A^{3}_{u}$ mode ($\sim$ 400 \cm) with cooling at $T_{N}$ is found to be $\sim$ 10 % for the TO mode. The mode is very broad at high temperatures and strongly narrows in the AFM phase. We attribute this effect to strong resonance coupling of this mode to optical or acoustic bi-magnons and reconstruction of the magnetic excitations spectrum at the N\'eel point.

  interactions: An equilibrium study","The formation of coherently strained three-dimensional islands on top of the wetting layer in Stranski-Krastanov mode of growth is considered in a model in 1+1 dimensions accounting for the anharmonicity and non-convexity of the real interatomic forces. It is shown that coherent 3D islands can be expected to form in compressed rather than in expanded overlayers beyond a critical lattice misfit. In the latter case the classical Stranski-Krastanov growth is expected to occur because the misfit dislocations can become energetically favored at smaller island sizes. The thermodynamic reason for coherent 3D islanding is the incomplete wetting owing to the weaker adhesion of the edge atoms. Monolayer height islands with a critical size appear as necessary precursors of the 3D islands. The latter explains the experimentally observed narrow size distribution of the 3D islands. The 2D-3D transformation takes place by consecutive rearrangements of mono- to bilayer, bi- to trilayer islands, etc., after exceeding the corresponding critical sizes. The rearrangements are initiated by nucleation events each next one requiring to overcome a lower energetic barrier.

The previously obtained nonperturbative solution based on the application of the impedance (the Leontovich) boundary conditons was used to calculate the effective impedance of a polycrystalline metal. When the Fermi surface is a surface of revolution, the expression for the effective impedance is rather simple. Some model Fermi surfaces were examined. In the vicinity of the electronic topological transition the singularities of the effective impedance related to the change of the topology of the Fermi surface were calculated.

We demonstrate that the antibaryon suppression in small systems due to the exact baryon number conservation is rather different in the baryon-free (B=0) and baryon-rich (B>1) systems. At constant values of temperature and baryon density in the baryon-rich systems the density of the produced antibaryons is only weakly dependent on the size of the system. For realistic hadronization conditions this dependence appears to be close to B/(B+1) which is in agreement with the preliminary data of the NA49 Collaboration for the antiproton/pion ratio in nucleus-nucleus collisions at the CERN SPS energies. However, a consistent picture of antibaryon production within the statistical hadronization model has not yet been achieved. This is because the condition of constant hadronization temperature in the baryon-free systems leads to a contradiction with the data on the antiproton/pion ratio in e+e- interactions.",Mark I.

This is an important observation, since, despite considerable effort of several groups, all attempts to realize spin-injection into a 2DEG using purely electrical measurements have failed sofar. However, in my opinion the claim made is not correct, and the observed behaviour can be explained by a combination of a magneto resistance (Hall) effect (e.g. generated by the fringe magnetic fields present at the edges of the ferromagnetic electrode), with a {\it spin-independent} rectification effect due to the presence of a metal- semiconductor junction.",B.

This could result in a grand unification scale M_X\approx 20 M_c. We study the corrections at the two-loop level. We find corrections of order (\mu/M_c)\alpha^2 for the gauge couplings and of order (\mu/M_c)^2\alpha^2 for the Yukawa couplings. Therefore, in the Yukawa sector one and two-loop contributions can be of the same order below M_X. We show that in the usual scenarios the dominant gauge and Yukawa couplings are decreasing functions of the scale, in such a way that (\mu/M_c)\alpha becomes approximately constant and two-loop contributions introduce just a 30% correction which does not increase with the scale.",M.

Taking advantage of the absence of any kinematical restriction and incoherent contribution, and pushing the instrumental resolution up to 1.5 meV, it was possible to perform an accurate investigation of the dynamic structure factor S(Q,E) in the wavevector range from 1 to 110 nm^-1. For Q smaller than Q_m=25 nm^-1, the position of the main peak of the static structure factor, a detailed analysis of the lineshapes shows that any picture of the relaxation mechanisms based on a simple viscoelastic model must be abandoned. All the spectral features can instead satisfactorily be accounted for by including both fast and slow relaxation processes. The physical origin of the slow relaxation is associated to the structural rearrangement, while the local nature of the fast one is extensively discussed.

The calculation of periodic orbit sums for the Baker map can be performed with the help of a Perron-Frobenius type operator. This makes it possible to study periodic orbit correlations for orbits with period up to 500 iterations of the map. Periodic orbit correlations are found to agree quantitatively with the predictions from random matrix theory up to a critical length determined by the semiclassical error.

To reveal the intimate connection between different decay modes and to be able to perform the calculations in the full physical $q^2$-region we use a relativistic dispersion approach based on the constituent quark picture. This approach gives the form factors as relativistic double spectral representations in terms of the wave functions of the initial and final mesons. The form factors have the correct analytic properties and satisfy general requirements of nonperturbative QCD in the heavy quark limit.   The disadvantages of quark models related to ill-defined effective quark masses and not precisely known meson wave functions are reduced by fitting the quark model parameters to lattice QCD results for the $B\to \rho$ transition form factors at large momentum transfers and to the measured total $D\to (K,K^*)l\nu$ decay rates.

A certain coverage, a beam structure and a level of uncorrelated noise define each experiment. We focus our atention on the reversion of the beam average. In each experiment, we look for the best pixelization for reversion, namely, for the pixelization that -after reversion- leads to good maps containing right spectra for the most wide range of angular scales. Squared pixels having different sizes ""smaller"" than the beam radius are considered. For a given size, the following question arises: How well can we assign a temperature to each pixel? Various mathematical methods are used to show that, in practice, this assignation -beam reversion or deconvolution- only leads to right spectra for pixel sizes greater than a certain lower limit close to the half of the beam radius. This limit is estimated for negligible and relevant levels of noise and also for spherically symmetric and asymmetric beams. After this general study, we focus our attention on two feasible detectors (which have been proposed to be on board of PLANCK satellite). For each of them, we estimate the size of the most appropriate pixelization compatible with beam reversion, difraction, observational strategy et cetera and, then, we answer the following question: Which is the part of the angular power spectrum which can be extracted from appropriately pixelized maps after deconvolution?",J.

For these, the conditions for periodic orbit pairs to be correlated (including correlations due to the unitarity of the transfer matrix) can be given explicitly.

Contrary to expectations, the stellar properties of Sk41 are typical of equivalent WN stars in the Galaxy and LMC, with T=42kK, log(L/Lo)=5.7, v_inf=1300 km/s, Mdot/sqrt(f)=3x10^-5 Mo/yr and H/He=2 by number, where f is the volume filling factor. The stellar luminosity of Sk41 is 50% below the minimum value predicted by single star evolutionary models at the metallicity of the SMC.   Emission line luminosities of HeII 4686A and CIV 5801-12A in SMC WR stars are not systematically lower than their Galactic and LMC counterparts. From 43 late-type and 59 early-type WN stars, log L(HeII)=36.0 erg/s and 35.8 erg/s respectively, while log L(CIV)=36.5 erg/s from 25 early-type WC stars. This new calibration has application in deriving WR populations in young starburst galaxies.   Synthetic WN models are calculated with identical parameters except that metal abundances are varied. Following the Smith et al. WN classification scheme, CNO equilibrium models reveal that earlier spectral types are predicted at lower metallicity, i.e. WN3--4 at 0.04 Z(solar) versus WN6 at 1.0 Z(solar).

nlin/0001027v2,Mean- Field Approximation and a Small Parameter in Turbulence Theory,"Numerical and physical experiments on two-dimensional (2d) turbulence show that the differences of transverse components of velocity field are well described by a gaussian statistics and Kolmogorov scaling exponents. In this case the dissipation fluctuations are irrelevant in the limit of small viscosity. In general, one can assume existence of critical space-dimensionality $d=d_{c}$, at which the energy flux and all odd-order moments of velocity difference change sign and the dissipation fluctuations become dynamically unimportant. At $d<d_{c}$ the flow can be described by the ``mean-field theory'', leading to the observed gaussian statistics and Kolmogorov scaling of transverse velocity differences. It is shown that in the vicinity of $d=d_{c}$ the ratio of the relaxation and translation characteristic times decreases to zero, thus giving rise to a small parameter of the theory. The expressions for pressure and dissipation contributions to the exact equation for the generating function of transverse velocity differences are derived in the vicinity of $d=d_{c}$. The resulting equation describes experimental data on two-dimensional turbulence and demonstrate onset of intermittency as $d-d_{c}>0$ and $r/L\to 0$ in three-dimensional flows in close agreement with experimental data. In addition, some new exact relations between correlation functions of velocity differences are derived.

The quantum discrete nonlinear Schroedinger model (DNLS) is our main objective, but its so called modified discrete nonlinear (MDNLS) version is also included, together with the fermionic polaron (FP) model. Based on the respective dynamical symmetries of the models, a method is put forward which by use of the associated boson and spin coherent state vectors (CSV) and a factorization ansatz for the solution of the Schroedinger equation, leads to quasiclassical Hamiltonian equations of motion for the CSV parameters. Analysing the geometrical content of the factorization ansatz made for the state vectors invokes the study of the Riemannian and symplectic geometry of the CSV manifolds as generalized phase spaces. Next, we investigate analytically and numerically the behavior of mean values and uncertainties of some physically interesting observables as well as the modifications in the quantum regime of processes such as the discrete self trapping (DST), in terms of the Q-function and the distribution of excitation quanta of the lattice sites. Quantum DST in the symmetric ordering of lattice operators is found to be relatively enhanced with respect to the classical DST.

  ISO/SWS spectroscopy","Neon abundances are derived in four Galactic WC stars -- gamma Vel (WR11, WC8+O7.5III), HD156385 (WR90, WC7), HD192103 (WR135, WC8), and WR146 (WC5+O8) - using mid-infrared fine structure lines obtained with ISO/SWS. Stellar parameters for each star are derived using a non-LTE model atmospheric code (Hillier & Miller 1998) together with ultraviolet (IUE), optical (INT, AAT) and infrared (UKIRT, ISO) spectroscopy. In the case of gamma Vel, we adopt results from De Marco et al. (2000), who followed an identical approach.   ISO/SWS datasets reveal the [NeIII] 15.5um line in each of our targets, while [NeII] 12.8um, [SIV] 10.5um and [SIII] 18.7um are observed solely in gamma Vel. Using a method updated from Barlow et al. (1988) to account for clumped winds, we derive Ne/He=3-4x10^-3 by number, plus S/He=6x10^-5 for gamma Vel. Neon is highly enriched, such that Ne/S in gamma Vel is eight times higher than cosmic values. However, observed Ne/He ratios are a factor of two times lower than predictions of current evolutionary models of massive stars. An imprecise mass-loss and distance were responsible for the much greater discrepancy in neon content identified by Barlow et al.   Our sample of WC5--8 stars span a narrow range in T* (=55--71kK), with no trend towards higher temperature at earlier spectral type, supporting earlier results for a larger sample by Koesterke & Hamann (1995).

Hipparcos has obtained parallaxes for nearby open clusters that have expected accuracies much better than has been previously achievable. By using the lithium depletion boundary method and isochrone fitting based on much improved new theoretical evolutionary models for low mass stars, it is arguable that we will soon have have much better age scales for clusters and star-forming regions. With improved optical and near-IR cameras, we are just now beginning to extend the mass function of open clusters like the Pleiades into the regime below the hydrogen burning mass limit.

The numerical solution of the free boundary problem is shown to possess self-similar intermediate asymptotics. On the other hand, the asymptotic solution can be obtained from a non-linear boundary value problem.

astro-ph/0001230v1,7Li in Metal-Poor Stars: The Spread of the Li Plateau,"A highly homogeneous study of 23 halo field dwarf stars has achieved a Li abundance accuracy of 0.033 dex per star. The work shows that the intrinsic spread of the Li abundances of these stars at a given metallicity is <0.02 dex, and consistent with zero. That is, the Spite Li plateau for halo field dwarfs is incredibly thin. The thinness rules out depletion by more than 0.1 dex by a rotational-induced extra-mixing mechanism. Despite the thinness of the plateau, an increase of Li with [Fe/H] is seen, interpreted as evidence of Galactic chemical evolution (GCE) of Li, primarily due to Galactic cosmic ray (GCR) spallation reactions in the era of halo formation. The rate of Li evolution is concordant with: (1) observations of spallative 6Li in halo dwarfs; (2) GCE models; and (3) data on Li in higher metallicity halo stars. New data have also revealed four new ultra-Li-deficient halo dwarfs, doubling the number known. Based on their propensity to cluster at the halo main sequence turnoff and also to exist redward of the turnoff, we hypothesise that they are the products of binary mergers that ultimately will become blue stragglers. We explain their low Li abundances by normal pre-main-sequence (and possibly main-sequence) destruction in the low mass stars prior to their merging. If this explanation is correct, then such stars need no longer be considered an embarrassment to the existence of negligible Li destruction in the majority of field halo dwarfs.",Sean G.

  luminous IRAS sources. III: Circumstellar Dust Properties","The James Clerk Maxwell Telescope has been used to obtain submillimeter and millimeter continuum photometry of a sample of 30 IRAS sources previously studied in molecular lines and centimeter radio continuum. All the sources have IRAS colours typical of very young stellar objects (YSOs) and are associated with dense gas. In spite of their high luminosities (L>10000 solar units), only ten of these sources are also associated with a radio counterpart. In 17 cases we could identify a clear peak of millimeter emission associated with the IRAS source, while in 9 sources the millimeter emission was extended or faint and a clear peak could not be identified; upper limits were found in 4 cases only.   Using simple greybody fitting model to the observed SED, we derive global properties of the circumstellar dust. The dust temperature varies from 24 K to 45 K, while the exponent of the dust emissivity vs frequency power-law spans a range 1.56<beta<2.38, characteristic of silicate dust; total circumstellar masses range up to more than 500 solar masses.   We find that for sources with comparable luminosities, the total column densities derived from the dust masses do not distinguish between sources with and without radio counterpart. We interpret this result as an indication that dust does not play a dominant role in inhibiting the formation of the HII region. We examine several scenarios for their origin in terms of newborn ZAMS stars and although most of these fail to explain the observations, we cannot exclude that these sources are young stars already on the ZAMS with modest residual accretion that quenches the expansion of the HII region. Finally, we consider the possibility that the IRAS sources are high-mass pre-ZAMS (or pre-H-burning) objects deriving most of the emitted luminosity from accretion.",Sergio Molinari; Jan Brand; Riccardo Cesaroni; Francesco Palla,astro-ph,astro-ph

Based on the color dipole representation, we investigate consequences for the $\gamma^{*}\gamma^{*},\gamma^{*}\gamma$ scattering of the incorporation of asymptotic freedom into the BFKL equation which makes the QCD pomeron a series of isolated poles in the angular momentum plane. The emerging color dipole BFKL-Regge factorization allows us to relate in a model-independent way the contributions of each BFKL pole to $\gamma^{*}\gamma^{*},\gamma^{*} \gamma$ scattering and DIS off protons. Numerical predictions based on our early works on color dipole BFKL phenomenology of DIS on protons are in a good agreement with the experimental data on the photon structure function $F_{2\gamma}$ and most recent data on the $\gamma^*\gamma^*$ cross section $\sigma^{\gamma^*\gamma^*}(Y)$ from OPAL and L3 experiments at LEP200.   We discuss the role of non-perturbative dynamics and predict pronounced effect of the Regge-factorization breaking due to large unfactorizable non-perturbative corrections to the perturbative vacuum exchange. We comment on the salient features of the BFKL-Regge expansion for $\gamma^{*}\gamma^{*},\gamma^{*}\gamma$ scattering including the issue of decoupling of subleading BFKL poles and the soft plus rightmost hard BFKL pole dominance .",N.

By reduction to the zero locus, we obtain relations between bracket operations and differentials arising in different complexes (the Gerstenhaber, Schouten, Berezin-Kirillov, and Sklyanin brackets); the equation ensuring the existence of a nilpotent vector field on the reduced manifold can be the classical Yang-Baxter equation.

math/0001076v1,Markov Transitions and the Propagation of Chaos,"The propagation of chaos is a central concept of kinetic theory that serves to relate the equations of Boltzmann and Vlasov to the dynamics of many-particle systems. Propagation of chaos means that molecular chaos, i.e., the stochastic independence of two random particles in a many-particle system, persists in time, as the number of particles tends to infinity.   We establish a necessary and sufficient condition for a family of general n-particle Markov processes to propagate chaos. This condition is expressed in terms of the Markov transition functions associated to the n-particle processes, and it amounts to saying that chaos of random initial states propagates if it propagates for pure initial states.   Our proof of this result relies on the weak convergence approach to the study of chaos due to Sznitman and Tanaka. We assume that the space in which the particles live is homeomorphic to a complete and separable metric space so that we may invoke Prohorov's theorem in our proof.   We also show that, if the particles can be in only finitely many states, then molecular chaos implies that the specific entropies in the n-particle distributions converge to the entropy of the limiting single-particle distribution.",Alexander David Gottlieb,math.PR,"math.PR; 60J (Primary), 82C05 (Secondary)"

The plateau value depends on the input-rate of cars at the on-ramp. The on-ramp acts as a local perturbation that separates the system into two regimes: A regime of free flow and another one where only jammed states exist. This phase separation is the reason for the plateau formation and implies a behaviour analogous to that of stationary defects. This analogy allows to perform very fast simulations of complex traffic networks with a large number of on- and off-ramps because one can parametrise on-ramps in an exceedingly easy way.",G.

In the minimal model, the nearness of the t quark Landau pole naturally suppresses the t-quark cubic soft breaking parameter at the electroweak scale allowing the electron and neutron experimental electric dipole moment (EDM) constraints to be satisfied with a large GUT scale phase. However, the EDM constraints require that $\theta_B$, the quadratic soft breaking parameter phase be small at the electroweak scale unless tan$\beta\stackrel{<}{\sim}3$, which then implies that at the GUT scale this phase must be large and highly fine tuned to satisfy radiative breaking of $SU(2)\times U(1)$. Similar results hold for non minimal models, and a possible GUT model is discussed where all GUT scale CP violating phases are naturally small (i.e. O($10^{-2})$). An interesting D-brane model is examined which enhances the size of the phases over much of the parameter space at the electroweak sector for tan$\beta\stackrel{<}{\sim} 5$, but still possesses the fine tuning problem at the GUT scale.",E.

The consequence of the existence of singular conservation laws for experimental data analysis, and also for the search for scale-invariant critical states via uncontrolled approximations in deterministic dynamical systems, is discussed.

Using the observed X-ray light curve as input we have computed the expected continuum UV emission as a function of time at several wavelengths (\l \l 1315 \AA, \l \l 6962 \AA, \l \l 15000 \AA, \l \l 30000 \AA) assuming that the X-ray source is located one \sc radius above the disk plane, with the mass of the black hole $M$ and the latitude angle $\theta$ of the observer relative to the disk plane as free parameters. We have searched the parameter space of black hole masses and observer azimuthal angles but we were unable to reproduce UV light curves which would resemble, even remotely, those observed. We also explored whether particular combinations of the values of these parameters could lead to light curves whose statistical properties (i.e. the autocorrelation and cross correlation functions) would match those corresponding to the observed UV light curve at \l \l 1315 \AA.

Extending earlier analytical results on the probability distribution function of the convergence field we show that the bias associated with the convergence field can directly be related to the bias associated with the statistics of underlying over-dense objects. This will provide us a direct method to study the gravity induced bias in galaxy clustering. Based on our analytical results which use the hierarchical {\em ansatz} for non-linear clustering, we study how such a bias depends on the smoothing angle and the source red-shift. We compare our analytical results against ray tracing experiments through N-body simulations of four different realistic cosmological scenarios and found a very good match.

We compare the exact lens equation with the standard lens equation, derived under the thin-lens-weak-field assumption (where the light rays are geodesics of the background with sharp bending in the lens plane, and the gravitational field is weak), and verify the fact that the standard weak-field thin-lens equation is inadequate at small impact parameter. We show that the second-order correction to the weak-field thin-lens equation is inaccurate as well. Finally, we compare the exact lens equation with the recently proposed strong-field thin-lens equation, obtained under the assumption of straight paths but without the small angle approximation, i.e., with allowed large bending angles.

Thus, the timing properties (PSD, lags, coherence) of the BHC light curves reflect, to a large extent, the properties of the scattering medium (which in this approximation acts as a combination of a {\sl linear} amplifier/filter) and they can be used to probe its structure, most notably the density profile of the scattering medium.

math-ph/0001019v5,Serendipity: Spacetime Invariance and Scale Effect,"A logic of reciprocity between inertial frames in relative uniform motion is investigated. Relativity allows any reference frame to apply Lorentz Transformation while reciprocity would require the relative frame to use Inverse Transformation for the same event, and vice versa. After such transformations, an inseparability between relativistic measurements and the covariant scale is examined. Scale conversion has been found to be necessary to preserve spacetime invariance in Special Relativity. A new derivation of the Lorentz Factor has been found based on the scale effect. The physical meaning of the Factor is that it serves as a scale conversion ratio between relative reference frames. Reciprocity in relativity and causality of covariance in relative motion are thereby conserved. These logical conclusions harmonize intrinsic natural invariances vis-a-vis apparent observational covariances.",Chao Y. Yang,math-ph,math-ph; math.MP
hep-ph/0001122v1,Reheating and Supersymmetric Flat-Direction Baryogenesis,"We re-examine Affleck-Dine baryo/leptogenesis from the oscillation of condensates along flat directions of the supersymmetric standard model, which attained large vevs at the end of inflationary epoque. The key observation is that superpotential interactions couple the flat directions to other fields, which acquire masses induced by the flat-direction vev that may be sufficiently small for them to be kinematically accessible to inflaton decay. The resulting plasma of inflaton decay products then may act on the flat directions via these superpotential Yukawa couplings, inducing thermal masses and supersymmetry-breaking A terms. In such cases the flat directions start their oscillations at an earlier time than usually estimated. The oscillations are also terminated earlier, due to evaporation of the flat direction condensate produced by its interaction with the plasma of inflaton decay products. In these cases we find that estimates for the resulting baryon/lepton asymmetry of the universe are substantially altered. We identify scenarios for the Yukawa couplings to the flat directions, and the order and mass scale of higher-dimensional superpotential interactions that set the initial flat direction vev, that might lead to acceptable baryo/leptogenesis.",Rouzbeh Allahverdi; Bruce.

We present a remarkably clean quantitative test of the duality at the level of $F^4$ couplings, by completely matching a purely one-loop heterotic amplitude to a purely tree-level type II result. The triality of SO(4,4) and several other miracles are shown to be crucial for the duality to hold.

In the lattice case, the outgoing modes arise via a Bloch oscillation from ingoing modes. A short distance cutoff on degrees of freedom is incompatible with local Lorentz invariance, but may nevertheless be compatible with general covariance if the preferred frame is defined non-locally by the cosmological background. Pursuing these ideas in a different direction, condensed matter analogs may eventually allow for laboratory observations of the Hawking effect.

astro-ph/0001233v4,Signatures for a Cosmic Flux of Magnetic Monopoles,"Any early universe phase transition occurring after inflation has the potential to populate the universe with relic magnetic monopoles. Observations of galactic magnetic fields, as well as observations matched with models for extragalactic magnetic fields, lead to the conclusion that monopoles of mass $\lsim 10^{15}$ GeV are accelerated in these fields to relativistic velocities. We explore the possible signatures of a cosmic flux of relativistic monopoles impinging on the earth. The electromagnetically-induced signatures of monopoles are reliable. The hadronically-induced signatures are highly model-dependent. Among our findings are (i) the electromagnetic energy losses of monopoles continuously initiate a protracted shower of small intensity; (ii) monopoles may traverse the earth's diameter, making them a probe of the earth's interior structure; (iii) in addition to the direct monopole Cherenkov signal presently employed, a very attractive search strategy for monopoles is detection of their radio-Cherenkov signal produced by the coherent charge-excess in the $e^+-e^-$ shower - in fact, Cherenkov-detectors have the potential to discover a monopole flux (or limit it) several orders of magnitude below the theoretical Parker limit of $10^{-15}/\rm{cm}^2$/s/sr; (iv) it is conceivable (but not compelling) that bound states of colored monopoles may be the primary particles initiating the air showers observed above the GZK cutoff.",Stuart D.

The angular momentum requirements of glitches in Vela indicate that at least 1.4% of the star's moment of inertia drives these events. If glitches originate in the liquid of the inner crust, Vela's `radiation radius' $R_\infty$ must exceed ~12 km for a mass of 1.4 solar masses.

Earth-matter effects can lift this degeneracy and induce an effectively maximal mixing between these two generations. This occurs if $\nu_e$'s contain comparable admixtures of the degenerate eigenstates, even rather small ones. This provides an explanation of the atmospheric neutrino anomaly in which the {\it ab initio} introduction of a large mixing angle is not required. To test this possibility we perform a novel and detailed analysis of the 52 kiloton-year SuperKamiokande data, and we find that in a large region of parameter space the corresponding confidence levels are excellent. The most recent results from the Chooz reactor experiment, however, severely curtail this region, so that the conventional scenario with nearly maximal mixing angles --which we also analyse in detail-- is supported by the data.",A.

astro-ph/0001247v2,Suppressing Linear Power on Dwarf Galaxy Halo Scales,"Recently is has been suggested that the dearth of small halos around the Milky Way arises due to a modification of the primordial power spectrum of fluctuations from inflation. Such modifications would be expected to alter the formation of structure from bottom-up to top-down on scales near where the short-scale power has been suppressed. Using cosmological simulations we study the effects of such a modification of the initial power spectrum. While the halo multiplicity function depends primarily on the linear theory power spectrum, most other probes of power are more sensitive to the non-linear power spectrum. Collapse of large-scale structures as they go non-linear regenerates a ``tail'' in the power spectrum, masking small-scale modifications to the primordial power spectrum except at very high-z. Even the small-scale (k>2h/Mpc) clustering of the Ly-alpha forest is affected by this process, so that CDM models with sufficient power suppression to reduce the number of 10^10 Msun halos by a factor of about 5 give similar Ly-alpha forest power spectrum results. We conclude that other observations that depend more directly on the number density of collapsed objects, such as the number of damped Ly-alpha systems, or the redshift of reionization may provide the most sensitive tests of these models.",Martin White; Rupert A.

astro-ph/0001249v1,A Unified Scaling Law in Spiral Galaxies,"We investigate the origin of a unified scaling relation in spiral galaxies. Observed spiral galaxies are spread on a plane in the three-dimensionallogarithmic space of luminosity L, radius R and rotation velocity V. The plane is expressed as $L \propto (V R)^{\alpha}$ in I-passband, where $\alpha$ is a constant. On the plane, observed galaxies are distributed in an elongated region which looks like the shape of a surfboard. The well-known scaling relations, L-V (Tully-Fisher relation), V-R (also the Tully-Fisher relation) and R-L (Freeman's law), can be understood as oblique projections of the surfboard-like plane into 2-D spaces. This unified interpretation of the known scaling relations should be a clue to understand the physical origin of all the relations consistently. Furthermore, this interpretation can also explain why previous studies could not find any correlation between TF residuals and radius.   In order to clarify the origin of this plane, we simulate formation and evolution of spiral galaxies with the N-body/SPH method, including cooling, star formation and stellar feedback. Initial conditions are set to isolated 14 spheres with two free parameters, such as mass and angular momentum. The CDM (h=0.5, $\Omega_0=1$) cosmology is considered as a test case. The simulations provide the following two conclusions: (a) The slope of the plane is well reproduced but the zero-point is not. This zero-point discrepancy could be solved in a low density ($\Omega_0<1$) and high expansion (h>0.5) cosmology.

It is argued that the failure of this more 'conventional' approach in comparison to experimental data should indicate the presence of a different phase which might be either attributed to space-time regions of vanishing scalar quark condensate ($<q\bar{q}>$ = 0) or to the presence of a QGP phase with strongly interacting partons.

To obtain a microscopic understanding of how islands/craters form in these conditions, we have conducted simulations of island and crater growth on Au(100), whose atomistic behavior, including the hex reconstruction on top of the square substrate, is well described by mean s of classical many-body forces. By increasing/decreasing the Au coverage on Au(100), we find that island/craters will not grow unless they exceed a critical size of about 8-10 atoms. This value is close to that which explains the nonlinear coverage dependence observed in molecular adsorption on the closely related surface Pt (100).

B 544, 403 (1999)) 2d quantum gravity theories --- including spherically reduced Einstein-gravity --- after an exact path integral of its geometric part can be treated perturbatively in the loops of (scalar) matter. Obviously the classical mechanism of black hole formation should be contained in the tree approximation of the theory. This is shown to be the case for the scattering of two scalars through an intermediate state which by its effective black hole mass is identified as a ``virtual black hole''. The present discussion is restricted to minimally coupled scalars without and with mass. In the first case the probability amplitude diverges, except the black hole is ``plugged'' by a suitable boundary condition. For massive scalars a finite S-matrix element is obtained.",D.

  in a soft photon field","The double and single differential cross-sections with respect to positron and electron energies as well as the total cross-section of triplet production in the laboratory frame are calculated numerically in order to develop a Monte Carlo code for modelling electron-photon cascades in a soft photon field. To avoid numerical integration irregularities of the integrands, which are inherent to problems of this type, we have used suitable substitutions in combination with a modern powerful program code Mathematica allowing one to achieve reliable higher-precission results. The results obtained for the total cross-section closely agree with others estimated analytically or by a different numerical approach. The results for the double and single differential cross-sections turn out to be somewhat different from some reported recently. The mean energy of the produced particles, as a function of the characteristic collisional parameter (the electron rest frame photon energy), is calculated and approximated by an analytical expression that revises other known approximations over a wide range of values of the argument. The primary-electron energy loss rate due to triplet pair production is shown to prevail over the inverse Compton scattering loss rate at several ($\sim$2) orders of magnitude higher interaction energy than that predicted formerly.",V.

The purpose of our survey is to study the effects of cluster mergers on the statistical properties of radio galaxies and to investigate the connection between mergers and the presence of radio halos and relic sources. We found that the radio source counts in the A3558 complex are consistent with the background source counts. Furthermore, we found that no correlation exists between the local density and the radio source power, and that steep spectrum radio galaxies are not segregated in denser optical regions. The radio luminosity function for elliptical and S0 galaxies is significantly lower than that for cluster type galaxies and for those not selected to be in clusters at radio powers logP(1.4) > 22.5, implying that the probability of a galaxy becoming a radio source above this power limit is lower in the Shapley Concentration compared with any other environment. The detection of a head-tail source in the centre of A3562, coupled with careful inspection of the 20 cm NRAO VLA Sky Survey (NVSS) and of 36 cm MOST observations, allowed us to spot two extended sources in the region between A3562 and SC1329-313, i.e. a candidate radio halo at the centre of A3562, and low brightness extended emission around a 14.96 magnitude Shapley galaxy.",T.

On this scheme, a Monte Carlo event generator (BABAYAGA) is developed for data analysis. To test the reliability of the approach, a benchmark calculation, including exact O(alpha) corrections and higher-order leading logarithmic contributions, is developed as well, implemented in a Monte Carlo integrator (LABSPV) and compared in detail with the BABAYAGA predictions.

In this paper, we restudy this constraint by further taking account the extended technicolor gauge boson correction which is positive. With this positive contribution to R_b, the constraint on the topcolor-assisted technicolor models from R_b changes significantly.

  geometry","The dynamics of a model, originally proposed for a type of instability in plastic flow, has been investigated in detail. The bifurcation portrait of the system in two physically relevant parameters exhibits a rich variety of dynamical behaviour, including period bubbling and period adding or Farey sequences. The complex bifurcation sequences, characterized by Mixed Mode Oscillations, exhibit partial features of Shilnikov and Gavrilov-Shilnikov scenario. Utilizing the fact that the model has disparate time scales of dynamics, we explain the origin of the relaxation oscillations using the geometrical structure of the bent-slow manifold. Based on a local analysis, we calculate the maximum number of small amplitude oscillations, $s$, in the periodic orbit of $L^s$ type, for a given value of the control parameter. This further leads to a scaling relation for the small amplitude oscillations. The incomplete approach to homoclinicity is shown to be a result of the finite rate of `softening' of the eigen values of the saddle focus fixed point. The latter is a consequence of the physically relevant constraint of the system which translates into the occurrence of back-to-back Hopf bifurcation.",S. Rajesh; G.

Since possible particle acceleration mechanisms in solar flares exhibit a preference of energizing particles in parallel direction, such an anisotropy is expected during the impulsive phase of a flare. The properties of the excited waves and the thresholds for instability are investigated by using linearized kinetic theory. These thresholds were connected to the pre-flare plasma parameters by assuming an acceleration model acting exclusively in parallel direction. For usually assumed pre-flare plasma conditions the electrons become unstable during the acceleration process and lefthand circularly polarized waves with frequencies of about the proton gyrofrequency are excited at parallel propagation.

This evidence is based upon high signal-to-noise, medium-resolution spectroscopy of the cores of early-type members of the Virgo and Coma clusters obtained with the WIYN 3.5-m telescope. The Virgo data were acquired using an integral-field unit (DensePak) allowing the velocity field to be sampled over a variety of spatial scales. The Coma data were obtained through single, 2-arcsec diameter fibers. The cross-correlation profiles of luminous ellipticals show considerable structure, often having several features with amplitudes as high as 10% that of the cross-correlation peak itself. This structure is most obvious within a radius of 1.5 arcsec (at Virgo), or < 100 pc, and is nearly undetectable when the data are binned over R < 15 arcsec, or < 1 kpc. Similar features are found in the single-fiber spectra of the luminous ellipticals in the Coma Cluster suggesting they are ubiquitous to giant ellipticals. Interesting, only the most luminous elliptical galaxies show this phenomena; the central regions of lower luminosity ellipticals have regular, Gaussian-like profiles. We interpret this kinematic structure as ``stellar streaming'' and suggest that this phenomena could be a relic signature of the merger history of luminous elliptical galaxies.",Michael J.

The coefficient of $s_{\lambda}$ in this product is denoted by $\gamma^{\lambda}_{{\mu}{\nu}}$, and corresponds to the multiplicity of the irreducible character $\chi^{\lambda}$ in $\chi^{\mu}\chi^{\nu}.$   We use Sergeev's Formula for a Schur function of a difference of two alphabets and the comultiplication expansion for $s_{\lambda}[XY]$ to find closed formulas for the Kronecker coefficients $\gamma^{\lambda}_{{\mu}{\nu}}$ when $\lambda$ is an arbitrary shape and $\mu$ and $\nu$ are hook shapes or two-row shapes.   Remmel \cite{Re1, Re2} and Remmel and Whitehead \cite{Re-Wh} derived some closed formulas for the Kronecker product of Schur functions indexed by two-row shapes or hook shapes using a different approach. We believe that the approach of this paper is more natural. The formulas obtained are simpler and reflect the symmetry of the Kronecker product.",Mercedes H.

Our study is based on radial velocities for 71 cluster members, respectively 30 for A222, 20 for A223 and 21 for A520, measured from spectra obtained at the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope, the European Southern Observatory, and the Pic du Midi Observatory, and supplemented with radial velocities from the literature. A222 galaxies have slightly higher velocities than those of A223, with bi-weighted mean velocity of V_{bi} = 64242 +/- 194 km/s for A222, and of V_{bi} = 63197 +/- 266 km/s for A223. The velocity dispersions of the two clusters are about the same: sigma_{bi} = 1013 +/- 150 km/s and sigma_{bi} = 1058 +/- 160 km/s for A222 and A223, respectively. For A520 we obtain V_{bi} = 60127 +/- 284 km/s with sigma_{bi} = 1250 +/- 189 km/s. We also give mass and mass-luminosities ratio estimates for each cluster separately. We argue that these clusters are presently undergoing strong dynamical evolution and that A222 and A223 will probably merge in the future. We have applied a Principal Component Analysis to a sample of 51 CFHT spectra to produce a spectral classification for these galaxies. This classification has allowed us to show that the morphological and kinematical segregations were already established in these intermediate redshift clusters.",D. Proust; H. Cuevas; H. V.

gr-qc/0001040v2,A proposal for analyzing the classical limit of kinematic loop gravity,"We analyze the classical limit of kinematic loop quantum gravity in which the diffeomorphism and hamiltonian constraints are ignored. We show that there are no quantum states in which the primary variables of the loop approach, namely the SU(2) holonomies along {\em all} possible loops, approximate their classical counterparts. At most a countable number of loops must be specified. To preserve spatial covariance, we choose this set of loops to be based on physical lattices specified by the quasi-classical states themselves. We construct ``macroscopic'' operators based on such lattices and propose that these operators be used to analyze the classical limit. Thus, our aim is to approximate classical data using states in which appropriate macroscopic operators have low quantum fluctuations.   Although, in principle, the holonomies of `large' loops on these lattices could be used to analyze the classical limit, we argue that it may be simpler to base the analysis on an alternate set of ``flux'' based operators. We explicitly construct candidate quasi-classical states in 2 spatial dimensions and indicate how these constructions may generalize to 3d. We discuss the less robust aspects of our proposal with a view towards possible modifications. Finally, we show that our proposal also applies to the diffeomorphism invariant Rovelli model which couples a matter reference system to the Hussain Kucha{\v r} model.",Madhavan Varadarajan; José A.

  plane: metallicity indices and morphology","The purpose of this study is to carry out a thorough investigation of the changes in morphology of the red giant branch (RGB) of Galactic globular clusters (GGC) as a function of metallicity, in the V,I bands. To this aim, two key points are developed in the course of the analysis.   (a) Using our photometric V,I database for Galactic globular clusters (the largest homogeneous data sample to date; Rosenberg et al. 1999) we measure a complete set of metallicity indices, based on the morphology and position of the red-giant branch. In particular, we provide here the first calibration of the S, DV_(1.1) and DV_(1.4) indices in the (V-I,V) plane. We show that our indices are internally consistent, and we calibrate each index in terms of metallicity, both on the Zinn & West (1984) and the Carretta & Gratton (1997) scales. Our new calibrations of the (V-I)o,g, DV_(1.2), (V-I)_(-3.0) and (V-I)_(-3.5) indices are consistent with existing relations.   (b) Using a grid of selected RGB fiducial points, we define a function in the {(V-I)o,Mi,[Fe/H]} space which is able to reproduce the whole set of GGC giant branches in terms of a single parameter (the metallicity). As a first test, we show that the function is able to predict the correct trend of our observed indices with metallicity.   The usage of this function will improve the current determinations of metallicity and distances within the Local Group, since it allows to easily map [(V-I)o,Mi] coordinates into {[Fe/H],Mi} ones.

astro-ph/0001267v1,Sunyaev-Zel'dovich Surveys: Analytic treatment of cluster detection,"Thanks to advances in detector technology and observing techniques, true Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) surveys will soon become a reality. This opens up a new window into the Universe, in many ways analogous to the X-ray band and inherently well-adapted to reaching high redshifts. I discuss the nature, abundance and redshift distributions of objects detectable in ground-based searches with state-of-the-art technology. An advantage of the SZ approach is that the total SZ flux density depends only on the thermal energy of the intracluster gas and not on its spatial or temperature structure, in contrast to the X-ray luminosity. Because ground-based surveys will be characterized by arcminute angular resolution, they will resolve a large fraction of the cluster population. I quantify the resulting consequences for the cluster selection function; these include less efficient cluster detection compared to idealized point sources and corresponding steeper integrated source counts. This implies, contrary to expectations based on a point source approximation, that deep surveys are better than wide ones in terms of maximizing the number of detected objects. At a given flux density sensitivity and angular resolution, searches at millimeter wavelengths (bolometers) are more efficient than centimeter searches (radio), due to the form of the SZ spectrum. Possible ground-based surveys could discover up to $\sim 100$ clusters per square degree at a wavelength of 2 mm and $\sim 10$/sq. deg. at 1 cm, modeling clusters as a simple self-similar population.",James G.

In a framework of this model a correlated state of two-electron molecular configuration is described by a set of symmetrized shell shifts q^\gamma similarly to the well known shell model developed for a description of the lattice dynamics. A set of q^\gamma-shifts are found after minimization of the energy functional. We present a number of the novel unconventional effects including: i) a correlational mechanism of the local pairing; ii) a correlational (pseudo) Jahn-Teller effect provided by a joint account of the electron shell shifts and conventional nuclear displacements; iii) an appearance of the chiral correlational states. The model allows an introduction of the pseudo-spin formalism and effective ""spin-Hamiltonian"" for a description of the short- and long-range ordering of non-rigid atomic backgrounds in crystals.

The presence of He I lines, with full width at half maximum ~ 2000 km/s, and the distinct absence of any other intermediate-width emission (e.g., Halpha), implies that the ejecta of SN Ic 1999cq are interacting with dense circumstellar material composed of almost pure helium. This strengthens the argument that the progenitors of SNe Ic are core-collapse events in stars that have lost both their hydrogen and helium envelopes, either through a dense wind or mass-transfer to a companion. In this way, SN 1999cq is similar to supernovae such as SN 1987K and SN 1993J that helped firmly establish a physical connection between Type Ib and Type II supernovae. The light curve of SN 1999cq is very fast, with an extremely rapid rise followed by a quick decline.

hep-ph/0001143v2,On gauge unification in Type I/I' models,"We discuss whether the (MSSM) unification of gauge couplings can be accommodated in string theories with a low (TeV) string scale. This requires either power law running of the couplings or logarithmic running extremely far above the string scale. In both cases it is difficult to arrange for the multiplet structure to give the MSSM result. For the case of power law running there is also enhanced sensitivity to the spectrum at the unification scale. For the case of logarithmic running there is a fine tuning problem associated with the light closed string Kaluza Klein spectrum which requires gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking on the ``visible'' brane with a dangerously low scale of supersymmetry breaking. Evading these problems in low string scale models requires a departure from the MSSM structure, which would imply that the success of gauge unification in the MSSM is just an accident.",Dumitru Ghilencea; Graham Ross,hep-ph,hep-ph

  medium","We calculate the thermochemical equilibrium of the diffuse interstellar medium, including ionization by a photon flux F_{nu} from neutrino decay. The main heating mechanism considered is photoelectrons from grains and PAHs. For the studied range of F_{nu} values, there always exists two regions of stability (a warm and a cold phase) that can coexist in equilibrium if the thermal interstellar pressure is between a maximum value P_{max} and a minimum value P_{min}. High F_{nu} values (~10^4-10^5 cm^{-2} s^{-1}) can be consistent with observed interstellar pressures only if more efficient sources are heating the gas. It is shown that a neutrino flux increase (due, for example, to an increase in the supernova explosion rate) may stimulate the condensation of cold gas by decreasing P_{max} below the interstellar pressure value.",Nestor Sanchez; Neyda Anez,astro-ph,astro-ph

astro-ph/0001272v1,"The MACHO Project: Microlensing Results from 5.7 Years of LMC
  Observations","We report on our search for microlensing towards the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC). Analysis of 5.7 years of photometry on 11.9 million stars in the LMC reveals 13 - 17 microlensing events. This is significantly more than the $\sim$ 2 to 4 events expected from lensing by known stellar populations. The timescales ($\that$) of the events range from 34 to 230 days. We estimate the microlensing optical depth towards the LMC from events with $2 < \that < 400$ days to be 1.2 ^{+0.4}_ {-0.3} \ten{-7}$, with an additional 20% to 30% of systematic error. The spatial distribution of events is mildly inconsistent with LMC/LMC disk self-lensing, but is consistent with an extended lens distribution such as a Milky Way or LMC halo. Interpreted in the context of a Galactic dark matter halo, consisting partially of compact objects, a maximum likelihood analysis gives a MACHO halo fraction of 20% for a typical halo model with a 95% confidence interval of 8% to 50%. A 100% MACHO halo is ruled out at the 95% C.L. for all except our most extreme halo model. Interpreted as a Galactic halo population, the most likely MACHO mass is between $ 0.15 \msun$ and $ 0.9 \msun$, depending on the halo model, and the total mass in MACHOs out to 50 kpc is found to be 9+4-3 10^{10} msun, independent of the halo model. These results are marginally consistent with our previous results, but are lower by about a factor of two. Besides a larger data set, this work also includes an improved efficiency determination, improved likelihood analysis, and more thorough testing of systematic errors, especially with respect to the treatment of potential backgrounds to microlensing, such as supernovae in galaxies behind the LMC.

astro-ph/0001276v1,"Implementing Feedback in Simulations of Galaxy Formation: A Survey of
  Methods","We present a detailed investigation of different approaches to modeling feedback in simulations of galaxy formation. Gas-dynamic forces are evaluated using Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) while star formation and supernova feedback are included using a three parameter model which determines the star formation rate normalization, feedback energy and lifetime of feedback regions. The star formation rate is calculated using a Lagrangian Schmidt Law for all gas particles which satisfy temperature, density and convergent flow criteria. Feedback is incorporated as thermal heating of the ISM. We compare the effects of distributing this energy over the smoothing scale or depositing it on a single particle. Radiative losses are prevented from heated particles by adjusting the density used in radiative cooling. We test the models on the formation of galaxies from cosmological initial conditions and also on isolated Milky Way and dwarf galaxies. Extremely violent feedback is necessary to produce a gas disk with angular momentum remotely close to that of observed disk galaxies. This is a result of the extreme central concentration of the dark halos in the sCDM model, and the pervasiveness of the core-halo angular momentum transport mechanism. We emphasize that the disks formed in hierarchical simulations are partially a numerical artifact produced by the minimum mass scale of the simulation acting as a highly efficient `support' mechanism. Disk formation is strongly affected by the treatment of dense regions in SPH, which along with the difficulty of representing the hierarchical formation process, means that realistic simulations of galaxy formation require far higher resolution than currently used.",R.

astro-ph/0001277v1,High Resolution Rotation Curves of Low Surface Brightness Galaxies,"High resolution Halpha rotation curves are presented for five low surface brightness galaxies. These Halpha rotation curves have shapes different from those previously derived from HI observations, probably because of the higher spatial resolution of the Halpha observations. The Halpha rotation curves rise more steeply in the inner parts than the HI rotation curves and reach a flat part beyond about two disk scale lengths. With radii expressed in optical disk scale lengths, the rotation curves of the low surface brightness galaxies presented here and those of HSB galaxies have almost identical shapes. Mass modeling shows that the contribution of the stellar component to the rotation curves may be scaled to explain most of the inner parts of the rotation curves, albeit with high stellar mass-to-light ratios. On the other hand, well fitting mass models can also be obtained with lower contributions of the stellar disk.

Shocks play an important role since they produce a high temperature zone where soft X-rays are emitted.   We show that in the optical-UV range, the slope of the NLR emission reproduces the observed values, and may be the main component of the featureless continuum. The presence of star forming regions cannot be excluded in the circumnuclear region of various Seyfert galaxies. An attempt is made to find their fingerprints in the observed AGN spectra.

The time intervals between consecutive ejection events is about 200-1,000 years, which is assumed to be the cycle period (the full magnetic cycle can be twice as long, as is the 22-year period in the sun). The magnetic field has no dynamical effects; it regulates the mass loss rate by the formation of magnetic cool spots. The enhanced magnetic activity at the cycle maximum results in more magnetic cool spots, which facilitate the formation of dust, hence increasing the mass loss rate. The strong magnetic activity implies that the AGB star is spun up by a companion, via a tidal or common envelope interaction. The strong interaction with a stellar companion explains the observations that the concentric semi-periodic shells are found mainly in bipolar PNs.",Noam Soker,astro-ph,astro-ph

Due to {\em transverse} kinetic hole fluctuations, empty domain walls are always anti-phase. At arbitrary electron filling fraction ($\delta $) of the domain wall (and in particular for $\delta \approx 1/4$ as in LaNdSrCuO), it is essential to account also for the transverse magnetic interactions of the electrons and their mobility {\em along} the domain wall.   We find that the transition from anti-phase to in-phase stripe domain wall occurs at a critical filling fraction $0.28<\delta_{c}<0.30$, for any value of $\frac{J}{t}<{1/3}$.

  of abundance gradients","The oxygen (O/H) and N/O abundance ratios along the bar of 16 barred spiral starburst galaxies are determined using long-slit spectroscopy. The abundance gradients and the spatial distribution of the ionized gas along the bar are used to understand the role of bars in starburst galaxies.   The oxygen abundance gradients are steeper than in normal barred galaxies, while the intersects are low. This excludes the possibility that these are chemically evolved galaxies rejuvenated by the effect of a bar. The nitrogen-to-oxygen abundance gradients are flatter than the oxygen ones. But N/O intersects are high, which rules out the possibility that a large quantity of gas was recently funneled by a bar toward the center of a young galaxy. Bars, therefore, cannot be at the origin of the bursts in the nuclei of our sample galaxies.   The oxygen and N/O abundance gradients are generally stronger in the bar than in the disk and are linked together by a linear relation. This can be fully explained in terms of star formation history: the gradients build up from the inside out, becoming stronger as the oxygen and N/O abundances increase in the bulge while staying low in the disk.   In many of the sample galaxies, star formation occurs at one or both ends of the bar. The low level of chemical enrichment in these regions suggests that they recently experienced bar-triggered star formation: this is the only visible effect of bars. Our analysis shows that bars probably appeared very recently (a few 10^7 years) in the starburst galaxies, which are relatively ""young"" galaxies still in the process of formation.(Abridged)",S.

astro-ph/0001287v1,The formation of bars and disks in Markarian starburst galaxies,"We have proposed in a companion paper (Considere et al. 2000) that bars appeared recently in massive starburst nucleus galaxies. We now test this hypothesis on an extended sample of barred and unbarred Markarian starburst galaxies, using several samples of normal galaxies as control samples.   In support of this hypothesis, we show that the proportion of barred galaxies is much lower in Markarian starburst galaxies than in normal galaxies. In addition to this deficiency of bars, we find that Markarian starburst galaxies have smaller disks than normal galaxies, and that the disks of unbarred starburst galaxies are smaller, on average, than barred ones. Finally, we show that the Markarian starburst galaxies do not seem to follow the local Tully--Fisher relation.   Various alternatives are examined to explain the deficiency of bars and the small disk dimensions in Markarian starburst galaxies. One possibility, which is in agreement with the young bar hypothesis, is that the formation of disks happens after the formation of bulges and that bars appear only later, when enough gas has been accreted in the disk.",R.

We find that the charge symmetry violation in the valence quark distribution is well below 1%, which is consistent with most low energy tests but significantly smaller than the quark model prediction about 5%-10%.

The questions we address concern their role in this field, the behavior of the scattering amplitude (or of the total cross-section) at high energy, and how to fit all high energy elastic data. The data are extremely well reproduced by our approach at all momenta and for sufficiently high energies. The relative virtues of Born amplitudes and of different kinds of eikonalizations are considered. An important point in this respect is that secondary structures are predicted in the differential cross-sections at increasing energies and these phenomena appear quite directly related to the procedure of eikonalizing the various Born amplitudes. We conclude that these secondary structures arise naturally within the eikonalized procedure (although their precise localization turns out to be model dependent). The fitting procedure naturally predicts the appearance of a zero at small $|t|$ in the real part of the even amplitude as anticipated by general theorems. We would like to stress, once again, how important it would be to have at LHC both $pp$ and $p \bar p$ options for many questions connected to the general properties of high energy hadronic physics and for a check of our predictions.",P.

A universal feature of phase boundaries is the appearance of increased fluctuations of conserved measures as manifested by excess measure variance compared to a reference. In this paper I consider a particular aspect of EbyE analysis emphasizing global-variables variance comparisons and the central limit theorem. I find that the central limit theorem is, in a broader interpretation, a statement about the scale invariance of total variance for a measure distribution, which in turn relates to the scale-dependent symmetry properties of the distribution.. I further generalize this concept to the relationship between the scale dependence of a covariance matrix for all conserved measures defined on a dynamical system and a matrix of covariance integrals defined on two-point measure spaces, which points the way to a detailed description of the symmetry dynamics of a complex measure system. Finally, I relate this generalized description to several recently proposed or completed event-by-event analyses.",T. A. Trainor,hep-ph,hep-ph

Therefore, it is possible to construct a well-defined chiral effective field theory at this energy scale, but high order correction of chiral expansion must be included simultanously. The one-loop correction of pseudoscalar mesons is also studied systematically. The unitarity of the model is examined and Breit-Wigner formula for $\rho$-meson is obtained.

They are explained by the existence of exact solutions which are attractors within the black hole threshold, that is, attractors of codimension one in phase space, and which are typically self-similar. This review gives an introduction to the phenomena, tries to summarize the essential features of what is happening, and then presents extensions and applications of this basic scenario.

The are relatively few first principles approaches to the study of quantum field theories [such as quantum chromodynamics (QCD) relevant to the strong interaction] away from the perturbative (i.e., weak-coupling) regime. Currently the most common method is the use of Monte Carlo methods on a hypercubic space-time lattice. These methods consume enormous computing power for large lattices and it is essential that increasingly efficient algorithms be developed to perform standard tasks in these lattice calculations. Here we present a general algorithm for QCD that allows one to put any planar improved gluonic lattice action onto a parallel computing architecture. High performance masks for specific actions (including non-planar actions) are also presented.

As the first application of these simulations, we have examined the density profiles of the halos. We found a clear systematic correlation between the halo mass and the slope of the density profile at one percent of the virial radius, in addition to the variations of the slope among halos of the similar mass. More specifically, the slope is $\sim - 1.5$, -1.3, and -1.1 for galaxy, group, and cluster mass halos, respectively.

The sensitivity of these experiments to nuclear structure is examined by using four different nuclear structure models with different spatial features using a full-folding optical potential model. The results show that elastic scattering at intermediate energies (<100 MeV per nucleon) is not a good constraint to be used to determine features of structure.

To this end we discuss standard problems, namely, the free particle, the quantum motion under a constant potential, a particle interacting with a potential step, and the motion of a particle under a harmonic potential. What is not so standard is that they are all conceived from momentum space and hence they, with the exception of the free particle, are not equivalent to the coordinate space ones with the same names.

physics/0001035v1,What Dimensions Do the Time and Space Have: Integer or Fractional?,"A theory of time and space with fractional dimensions (FD) of time and space ($d_{\alpha}, \alpha=t,{\bf r})$ defined on multifractal sets is proposed. The FD is determined (using principle of minimum the functionals of FD) by the energy densities of Lagrangians of known physical fields. To describe behaviour of functions defined on multifractal sets the generalizations of the fractional Riemann-Liouville derivatives $D_{t}^{d(t)}$ are introduced with the order of differentiation (depending on time and coordinate) being equal the value of fractional dimension. For $d_{t}=const$ the generalized fractional derivatives (GFD) reduce to ordinary Riemann-Liouville integral functionals, and when $d_{t}$ is close to integer, GFD can be represented by means of derivatives of integer order. For time and space with fractional dimensions a method to investigate the generalized equations of theoretical physics by means of GFD is proposed. The Euler equations defined on multifractal sets of time and space are obtained using the principle of the minimum of FD functionals. As an example, a generalized Newton equation is considered and it is shown that this equation coincide with the equation of classical limit of general theory of relativity for $d_{t} \to 1$. Several remarks concerning existence of repulsive gravitation are discussed.

For the wavelengths much larger than the string scale only a small fraction of the energy escapes in the form of dipole radiation. The physical interpretation is that a string attached to the 3-brane manifests itself as an electric charge, and waves on the string cause the end point of the string to freely oscillate and produce electromagnetic dipole radiation in the asymptotic outer region.

It demonstrates experimentally observed features of traffic flow such as the existence of three regimes: free, fluctuative (synchronized) and congested (jammed) flow; bistability of free and fluctuative states in a certain range of densities, which causes the hysteresis in transitions between these states; jumps in the density-flux plane in the fluctuative regime and gradual spatial transition from synchronized to free flow. Our model suggests that in the fluctuative regime there exist many stable states with different wavelengths, and that the velocity fluctuations in the congested flow regime decay approximately according to a power law in time.",Elad Tomer; Leonid Safonov; Shlomo Havlin,cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.dis-nn
astro-ph/0001292v2,VSL theories and the Doppler peak,"We discuss constraints on so-called `varying speed of light theories' coming from the physics of the early universe. Specifically, we consider the position of the first acoustic peak of the CMB angular power spectrum, showing that the recent determination of its position by various CMB experiments, in particular BOOMERanG/NA, can be used to constrain the value of the speed of light $c$ after the epoch of last scattering. Specifically, we find that for a flat universe and a standard density of baryonic matter a variation in $c$ of up to 4% is consistent with the current observations. The position of the Doppler peak is fairly sensitive to changes in $c$, and future observations should dramatically improve this bound. On the other hand, we also find that the maximum baryonic density allowed in VSL theories is about $\Omega_B h^2\sim 0.06\Omega_0$. We comment on the significance of these results.",P. P. Avelino; C.

  Microscope",We discuss the local cutting of single-walled carbon nanotubes by a voltage pulse to the tip of a scanning tunneling microscope. The tip voltage ($\mid V \mid \ge $~3.8 eV) is the key physical quantity in the cutting process. After reviewing several possible physical mechanisms we conclude that the cutting process relies on the weakening of the carbon-carbon bonds through a combination of localized particle-hole excitations induced by inelastically tunneling electrons and elastic deformation due to the electric field between tip and sample. The carbon network releases part of the induced mechanical stress by forming topological defects that act as nucleation centers for the formation of dislocations that dynamically propagate towards bond-breaking.,Angel Rubio; S.

Although CADIS was designed as an extragalactic survey, it also attempts to identify the stars in the fields in order to avoid confusion with quasars and compact galaxies. We have identified a sample of about 300 faint stars 15.5< R < 23), which are well suited to study the structure of the Galaxy. The stars lie in two fields, hereafter 16h and 9h field, respectively. The stars have been separated from galaxies by a classification scheme based on photometric spectra and morphological criteria. Distances were derived by photometric parallaxes. We are able to find stars up to distances of approximately 25 kpc above the Galactic plane. The vertical density distribution of the stars shows the contribution of the thin disk, the stellar halo and the ``thick disk'' of the Galaxy. We give quantitative descriptions of the components in terms of exponential disks and a de Vaucouleurs spheroid. For the disk stars we derive the luminosity function.

A given branch either bifurcates from another one at an intermediate value of $\alpha$ or persists in the limit $\alpha \to 0$ where it terminates into a flat sphaleron or bisphaleron or into a Bartnik-McKinnon solution.

The thick HI disk prevents the disk gas from expanding freely upwards, unless some highly energetic event such as chimneys occurs, whereas the thick HII disk acts as a disk-halo interaction region from where the hot ionized gas flows freely into the halo.   The upflowing gas reaches the maximum height at $z\sim 9.3\pm 1$ kpc becoming thermally unstable due to radiative losses, and condenses into HI clouds. Because the major fraction of the gas is gravitationally bound to the Galaxy, the cold gas returns to the disk. The descending clouds will have at some height high velocities.

It is defined as integrated out the truly nonperturbative part of the full gluon propagator over the deep infrared region (soft momentum region). The nontrivial minimization procedure makes it possible to determine the value of the soft cutoff in terms of the corresponding nonperturbative scale parameter which is inevitably presented in any nonperturbative model for the full gluon propagator. If the chosen Ansatz for the full gluon propagator is a realistic one, then our method uniquely determines the truly vacuum energy density, which is always finite, automatically negative and it has no imaginary part (stable vacuum). We illustrate it by considering the Abelian Higgs model of dual QCD ground state.

The relic superheavy particles are very efficiently produced at inflation. Being protected by gauge discrete symmetries, they can be long lived. They are clustering in the Galactic halo, producing thus UHECR without Greisen-Zatsepin-Kuzmin cutoff. Topological Defects can naturally produce particles with energies as observed and much higher, but in most cases fail to produce the observed fluxes.

We first consider the possibility that this spectroscopic feature results from a quasi-static charge ordering taking place in the underdoped regime. It comes out that to explain the coexistence of gaps and arcs on the Fermi surface the charge modulation should be in an eggbox form. In the lack of evidences for that, we then investigate the local pairing induced by charge-stripe fluctuations. A proper description of the strong anisotropy of both the interactions and the Fermi velocities requires a two-gap model for pairing. We find that a gap due to incoherent pairing forms near the M-points, while coherence is established by the stiffness of the pairing near the nodal points. The model allows for a continuos evolution from a pure BCS pairing (over- and optimally doped regime) to a mixed boson-fermion model (heavily underdoped regime).",C. Castellani; C. Di Castro; M.

This technique requires that the jet angle to the line of sight and the ratio of pattern to flow velocities are sufficiently constrained. We evaluate a number of possibilities for constraining these parameters and demonstrate the technique on a well defined component in the parsec scale jet of the quasar 3C279 (z = 0.536). We find an angular size distance to 3C279 of greater than 1.8 (+0.5,-0.3) n^{1/8} Gpc, where n is the ratio of the energy density in the magnetic field to the energy density in the radiating particles in that jet component.

gr-qc/0001048v2,"On Gravity, Holography and the Quantum","The holographic principle states that the number of degrees of freedom describing the physics inside a volume (including gravity) is bounded by the area of the boundary (also called the screen) which encloses this volume. A stronger statement is that these (quantum) degrees of freedom live on the boundary and describe the physics inside the volume completely. The obvious question is, what mechanism is behind the holographic principle. Recently, 't Hooft argued that the quantum degrees of freedom on the boundary are not fundamental. We argue that this interpretation opens up the possibility that the mapping between the theory in the bulk (the holographic theory) and the theory on the screen (the dual theory) is always given by a (generalized) procedure of stochastic quantization. We show that gravity causes differences to the situation in Minkowski/Euclidean spacetime and argue that the fictitious coordinate needed in the stochastic quantization procedure can be spatial. The diffusion coefficient of the stochastic process is in general a function of this coordinate. While a mapping of a bulk theory onto a (quantum) boundary theory can be possible, such a mapping does not make sense in spacetimes in which the area of the screen is growing with time. This is connected to the average process in the formalism of stochastic quantization. We show where the stochastic quantization procedure breaks down and argue, in agreement with `t Hooft, that the quantum degrees of freedom are not fundamental degrees of freedom.

In the first hours to days after the burst a major, and unique tool, will be provided through the study of dynamically evolving radio spectra, caused by diffractive and refractive scintillation in the local ISM. Simultaneous observations from optically thin to optically thick frequencies will provide strong constraints on any model for the GRB remnant. SKA will also allow for extremely rapid (within minutes, if not seconds) follow-up observations by electronic steering of the array. SKA observations have the sensitivity to detect GRB afterglows out to redshifts of 10 or greater. They therefore allow studies of the high redshift universe, and measure the massive star formation (and massive star death rate!) history of the universe, unbiased by optical obscuration. Wide field surveys may detect thousands of GRBs within a few days of observing (depending on the amount of collimation, the width of the GRB luminosity function, the number of GRBs like GRB 980425/SN 1998bw). There would be new ones, but many more would be old, fading afterglows, allowing the determination of the multi-variate GRB-optical-radio luminosity function of GRBs. This should elucidate the relation of the `faint' ones, like GRB 980425, to the luminous ones like GRB 970508.

They can be generated from ambidextrous Hilbert spaces in a tensor C*-category. The algebraic analogue of the Takesaki-Tatsuuma Duality Theorem characterizes abstractly C*-algebras acted on by unital endomorphisms that are intrinsically related to the regular representation of a multiplicative unitary. The relevant C*-algebras turn out to be simple and indeed separable if the corresponding multiplicative unitaries act on a separable Hilbert space. A categorical analogue provides internal characterizations of minimal representation categories of a multiplicative unitary. Endomorphisms of the Cuntz algebra related algebraically to the grading are discussed as is the notion of braided symmetry in a tensor C*-category.,S. Doplicher; C. Pinzari; J. E.

Given a probability distribution on two discrete variables, $p_{ij}$, we define the correlation-destroying transformation $C: p_{ij} \to \pi_{ij}$, which creates a new distribution on those same variables in which no correlation exists between the variables, i.e. $\pi_{ij} = P_i Q_j$. It is then shown that the entropy obeys the relation $S({\bf p}) \leq S({\bf \pi}) = S({\bf P}) + S({\bf Q})$, i.e. the entropy is non-decreasing under these correlation-destroying transformations.",John H.

The very low value of oxygen abundance previously reported is confirmed and a very homogeneous abundance distribution is found (no variation larger than 0.05 dex) over the whole ionized region. We concur with Tenorio-Tagle (1996) and Devost et al. (1997) that the observed abundance level cannot result from the material ejected by the stars formed in the current burst, and propose that the observed metals were formed in a previous star formation episode. Metals ejected in the current burst of star formation remain most probably hidden in a hot phase and are undetectable using optical spectroscopy. We discuss different scenarios of star formation in IZw 18. Combining various observational facts, for instance the faint star formation rate observed in low surface brightness galaxies van Zee et al. (1997), it is proposed that a low and continuous rate of star formation occurring during quiescent phases between bursts could be a significant source of metal enrichment of the interstellar medium.",F.

These states will be visible to experiment and in fact provide the first signatures of the presence of a low quantum gravity scale.

The idea has remained curiously untested since it was proposed, but if our analysis is correct, such techniques could provide a significant alternative approach to air shower detection in a standalone array with high duty cycle, and might provide highly complementary measurements of air showers detected in existing and planned ground arrays such as the Fly's Eye or the Auger Project. The method should be particularly sensitive to showers that are transverse to and relatively distant from the detector, and is thus effective in characterizing penetrating horizontal showers such as those that might be induced by ultra-high energy neutrino primaries.",Peter.

  non-Fermi-liquid behavior in a purely repulsive 2D electron system","We investigate a microscopic model for strongly correlated electrons with both on-site and nearest neighbor Coulomb repulsion on a 2D square lattice. This exhibits a state in which electrons undergo a ``somersault'' in their internal spin-space (spin-flux) as they traverse a closed loop in external coordinate space. When this spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic (AFM) insulator is doped, the ground state is a liquid of charged, bosonic meron-vortices, which for topological reasons are created in vortex-antivortex pairs. The magnetic exchange energy of the distorted AFM background leads to a logarithmic vortex-antivortex attraction which overcomes the direct Coulomb repulsion between holes localized on the vortex cores. This leads to the appearance of pre-formed charged pairs. We use the Configuration Interaction (CI) Method to study the quantum translational and rotational motion of various charged magnetic solitons and soliton pairs. The CI method systematically describes fluctuation and quantum tunneling corrections to the Hartree-Fock Approximation (HFA). We find that the lowest energy charged meron-antimeron pairs exhibit d-wave rotational symmetry, consistent with the symmetry of the cuprate superconducting order parameter. For a single hole in the 2D AFM plane, we find a precursor to spin-charge separation in which a conventional charged spin-polaron dissociates into a singly charged meron-antimeron pair. This model provides a unified microscopic basis for (i) non-Fermi-liquid transport properties, (ii) d-wave preformed charged carrier pairs, (iii) mid-infrared optical absorption, (iv) destruction of AFM long range order with doping and other magnetic properties, and (v) certain aspects of angled resolved photo-emission spectroscopy (ARPES).",Mona Berciu; Sajeev John,cond-mat.supr-con,cond-mat.supr-con; cond-mat.str-el

Such theories include two-color QCD with quarks in the fundamental representation of the color group as well as any-color QCD with quarks in the adjoint color representation. In all such theories the lightest baryons are diquarks. At zero chemical potential $\mu$ they are, together with the pseudoscalar mesons, the Goldstone modes of a spontaneously broken enlarged chiral symmetry group. Using symmetry principles, we derive the low-energy effective Lagrangian for these particles. We find that a second order phase transition occurs at a value of $\mu$ equal to half the mass of the Goldstone modes. For values of $\mu$ beyond this point the scalar diquarks Bose condense and the diquark condensate is nonzero. We calculate the dependence of the chiral condensate, the diquark condensate, the baryon charge density, and the masses of the diquark and pseudoscalar excitations on $\mu$ at finite bare quark mass and scalar diquark source.

This remarkable phenomenon of the ultra-slow EIT polariton is based on the spatial dispersion of the refraction index $n(\w,k)$, i.e., its wavenumber dependence, which is due to atomic motion and provides a negative contribution to the group velocity.

We demonstrate how the anomaly (and the coupling to the dilaton/axion) can appear in the Lagrangian and associated field equations as a controlled perturbation about the standard Nielsen-Olesen equations. In such a picture, the additional field equation for the dilaton becomes a series of corrections to a constant dilaton vev as the anomaly is turned on. In particular we find that even the first nontrivial correction to a constant dilaton generically leads to a (positive) logarithmic divergence of the heterotic dilaton near the vortex core. Since the dilaton field governs the strength of quantum fluctuations in string theory, this runaway behaviour implies that anomalous U(1) vortices in string theory are intrinsically quantum mechanical objects.",Bruce A.

We also find spatial gradients in several abundance ratios, indicating that the fraction of iron from SN Ia increases toward the cluster center. The dominant metal enrichment mechanism near the cluster center must therefore be different than in the outer parts. We show that ram pressure stripping of gas from cluster galaxies cannot account for the central abundance enhancement. We suggest that two successive stages of galactic winds contaminate intracluster gas: protogalactic winds driven by SN II, followed by less energetic winds driven by SN Ia, which have longer lived progenitors than SN II. The less energetic secondary wind from a cD galaxy may be suppressed, due to its location at the cluster center, leading to the observed central enhancement of SN Ia ejecta.",Raymond E.

We show that this boundary condition naturally arises from a small extra dimension and present a complete model which includes a new extra-dimensional solution to the mu problem. We briefly discuss the predicted superpartner spectrum as a function of the two parameters of the model.

While the afterglows of GRBs in radio, optical and X-ray bands are successfully explained by the fireball model, a significant difficulty with the proposed mechanisms for GRBs is that a small amount ($\le 10^{-6} M_{\odot}$) of baryons in the ejecta can be involved. There are very few models that fulfill this criteria together with other observational features, among which are the differentially rotating collapsed object model and the ""supernova"" model. These models generally invoke rapidly rotating neutron stars, and may be subject to uncertainties in the formation mechanisms and the equations of state of neutron stars. According to Spruit, the problem of making a GRB from an X-ray binary is reduced to finding a plausible way to make the star rotate differentially. We suggest that a model of strange star (SS) can naturally explain many of these bursts with not only their low baryon content, but the differential rotation which leads to an enhanced magnetic field that surfaces up and is responsible for GRBs.",Jishnu Dey; Subharthi Ray; Xiang-Dong Li; Mira Dey; Ignazio Bombaci,astro-ph,astro-ph

We pay special attention to how this Hamiltonian depends on quantities which are external to the constraint manifold, such as the external curvature of the constraint manifold, the (Riemannian) curvature of the ambient space, and the constraining potential. In particular, we find the remarkable fact that the twisting of the constraining potential appears as a gauge potential in the constrained Hamiltonian. This gauge potential is an example of geometric phase, closely related to that originally discussed by Berry. The constrained Hamiltonian also contains an effective potential depending on the external curvature of the constraint manifold, the curvature of the ambient space, and the twisting of the constraining potential.

As the impurity concentration is increased, it is found that (i) the integrated spectral weight is rapidly reduced, (ii) a pseudo-gap feature opens up at small frequencies, and (iii) at larger frequencies a discrete peak structure emerges, dominated by the contributions of the smallest cluster segments. The corresponding low-temperature thermodynamic response has a divergent contribution due to the odd-site clusters and a sub-dominant exponentially activated component due to the even-site segments whose finite-size gap is responsible for the spectral weight suppression at small frequencies. Based on simple scaling arguments, approximate low-temperature expressions are derived for the uniform susceptibility and the heat capacity.

In addition, we produce colour dependent model light-curves by combining high-resolution microlensing simulations with a realistic model for a thermal accretion disc source. We make hypothetical target of opportunity spectroscopic observations using our determination of the appropriate trigger as a guide.

OGLE collaboration, Apache Point Observatory) in the hope of observing a high magnification event (HME). Over the past three seasons (1997-1999) the OGLE collaboration has produced microlensing light-curves with unprecedented coverage. These demonstrate smooth, independent (therefore microlensing) variability between the images (Wozniak et al. 2000a,b; OGLE web page). We have retrospectively compared probability functions for high-magnification event parameters with several observed light-curve features. We conclude that the 1999 image C peak was due to the source having passed outside of a cusp rather than to a caustic crossing. In addition, we find that the image C light-curve shows evidence for a caustic crossing between the 1997 and 1998 observing seasons involving the appearance of new critical images. Our models predict that the next image C event is most likely to arrive 500 days following the 1999 peak, but with a large uncertainty (100-2000 days). Finally, given the image A light-curve derivative at the end of the 1999 observing season, our modelling suggests that a caustic crossing will occur between the 1999 and 2000 observing seasons, implying a minimum for the image A light-curve ~1-1.5 magnitudes fainter than the November 1999 level.",J.

The numerical solution of the dynamical evolution equations shows that the zero-mode quantum fluctuations cannot grow macroscopically large starting from microscopic initial conditions. Thus we conclude that there is no evidence for a dynamical Bose-Einstein condensation, in the usual sense.

astro-ph/0001308v2,"The infrared side of galaxy formation. I. The local universe in the

This combines a semi-analytic galaxy formation model based on hierarchical clustering (GALFORM) with a spectro-photometric code which includes dust reprocessing (GRASIL). The former provides the star formation and metal enrichment histories, together with the gas mass and various geometrical parameters, for a representative sample of galaxies formed in different density environments. These quantities allow us to model the SEDs of galaxies, taking into account stellar emission and also dust extinction and re-emission. Two phases are considered for the dust: molecular cloud complexes, where stars are assumed to be born, and the diffuse interstellar medium. The model includes both galaxies forming stars quiescently in disks, and starbursts triggered by galaxy mergers. We test our models against the observed spectro-photometric properties of galaxies in the local Universe. The models reproduce fairly well the SEDs of normal spirals and starbursts, and their internal extinction properties. The starbursts follow the observed relationship between the FIR to UV luminosity ratio and the slope of the UV continuum. They also reproduce the observed starburst attenuation law (Calzetti et al 99). This result is remarkable, because we use a dust mixture which reproduces the Milky Way extinction law. It suggests that the observed attenuation law is related to the geometry of the stars and dust. We compute galaxy luminosity functions over our wide range of wavelengths, which turn out to be in good agreement with observational data. The UV continuum turns out to be a poor star formation indicator for our models, whilst the infrared luminosity is much more reliable.",G. L. Granato; C. G. Lacey; L. Silva; A. Bressan; C. M.

The mean-field coupled time-dependent Schroedinger equations for the modes of the scalar field are derived and the suitable procedure to renormalize them is outlined. A further controlled gaussian approximation of our tdHF approach is used in order to study the dynamical evolution of the system from non-equilibrium initial conditions characterized by a uniform condensate. We find that, during the slow rolling down, the long-wavelength quantum fluctuations do not grow to a macroscopic size but do scale with the linear size of the system, in accordance with similar results valid for the large $N$ approximation of the O(N) model. This behavior undermines in a precise way the gaussian approximation within our tdHF approach, which therefore appears as a viable mean to correct an unlikely feature of the standard HF factorization scheme, such as the so-called ``stopping at the spinodal line'' of the quantum fluctuations. We also study the dynamics of the system in infinite volume with particular attention to the asymptotic evolution in the broken symmetry phase.

On the contrary, it mainly results from strong cooperative Jahn-Teller deformations. Those involve a compression of the Mn-O octahedron along the c-axis (mode Q_3 < 0), while alternate Jahn-Teller deformations occur in the ab-plane (mode Q_2). These deformations stabilize a certain type of orbital ordering. The resulting superexchange couplings are calculated by exact diagonalization, taking into account both e_g and t_{2g} orbitals. The main result is that antiferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) coupling along the c-direction (ab-planes) can be understood only if the Jahn-Teller energy is much larger than the superexchange couplings, which is consistent with experiments. This mechanism contrasts with that based on weak Jahn-Teller coupling which instead predicts elongation along the c-axis (Q_3 > 0).

For a multicomponent system we derive a coupled dispersion relation and show that two sources of coupling appear: (i) a coupling of isoscalar and isovector modes due to the action of different mean-fields and (ii) an explicit new coupling in asymmetric matter due to collisional interaction. We show that the latter is responsible for a new mode arising besides isovector and isoscalar modes...(abbreviated) Collective motion beyond the linear regime is demonstrated for the example of large-amplitude isoscalar giant octupole excitations in finite nuclear systems.

cond-mat/0001246v2,Geometric origin of mechanical properties of granular materials,"Some remarkable generic properties, related to isostaticity and potential energy minimization, of equilibrium configurations of assemblies of rigid, frictionless grains are studied. Isostaticity -the uniqueness of the forces, once the list of contacts is known- is established in a quite general context, and the important distinction between isostatic problems under given external loads and isostatic (rigid) structures is presented. Complete rigidity is only guaranteed, on stability grounds, in the case of spherical cohesionless grains. Otherwise, the network of contacts might deform elastically in response to load increments, even though grains are rigid. This sets an uuper bound on the contact coordination number. The approximation of small displacements (ASD) allows to draw analogies with other model systems studied in statistical mechanics, such as minimum paths on a lattice. It also entails the uniqueness of the equilibrium state (the list of contacts itself is geometrically determined) for cohesionless grains, and thus the absence of plastic dissipation. Plasticity and hysteresis are due to the lack of such uniqueness and may stem, apart from intergranular friction, from small, but finite, rearrangements, in which the system jumps between two distinct potential energy minima, or from bounded tensile contact forces. The response to load increments is discussed. On the basis of past numerical studies, we argue that, if the ASD is valid, the macroscopic displacement field is the solution to an elliptic boundary value problem (akin to the Stokes problem).",Jean-Noel Roux,cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.soft; cond-mat.dis-nn; cond-mat.stat-mech

Counterintuitively, due to the nonlinear nature of the effect, errors in the flat-sky approximation do not improve on smaller scales. They remain at the 10% level through the acoustic regime and are sufficiently large to merit adoption of the all-sky formalism. For the bispectra, a cosmic variance limited detection of the correlation with secondary anisotropies has an order of magnitude greater signal-to-noise for combinations involving magnetic parity polarization than those involving the temperature alone.

One of the problems related to an instability in the baryon number fluctuation of the chiral symmetry breaking phase of the quark system in the local theory is shown to exist. Such an instability problem is removed by taking into account the statistical blocking effects for the quark propagator, which depends on a macroscopic {\em statistical blocking parameter} $\epsilon$.

astro-ph/0001311v1,"Supermassive Black Holes Can Hardly Be ""Silent""","There is now ample evidence that most - perhaps all - galactic spheroids host a supermassive BH at their center. This has been assessed using a variety of observational techniques, from stellar and/or gas dynamics to megamasers. Yet another promising technique is offered by the case of the Virgo elliptical NGC 4552, in which early HST/FOC observations revealed a central low-luminosity flare. Subsequent HST/FOS observations with a 0.21 arcsec aperture have revealed a rich emission-line spectrum with broad and narrow components with FWHM of 3000 and 700 km/s, respectively. This variable, mini-AGN at the center of NGC 4552 is most naturally the result of a sporadic accretion event on a central BH. It has a H$\alpha$ luminosity of only $\sim 10,000 \lsun$, making it the likely, intrinsically faintest AGN known today. Only thanks to the superior resolution of HST such a faint object has been discovered and studied in detail, but adaptive optics systems on large ground-based telescopes may reveal in the future that a low level of accretion onto central massive BHs is an ubiquitous phenomenon among galactic spheroids. FOC/FOS observations of a central spike in NGC 2681 reveal several analogies with the case of NGC 4552, while yet another example is offered by a recent exciting finding with STIS by R.W.

nlin/0001035v1,Levy Anomalous Diffusion and Fractional Fokker--Planck Equation,"We demonstrate that the Fokker-Planck equation can be generalized into a 'Fractional Fokker-Planck' equation, i.e. an equation which includes fractional space differentiations, in order to encompass the wide class of anomalous diffusions due to a Levy stable stochastic forcing. A precise determination of this equation is obtained by substituting a Levy stable source to the classical gaussian one in the Langevin equation. This yields not only the anomalous diffusion coefficient, but a non trivial fractional operator which corresponds to the possible asymmetry of the Levy stable source. Both of them cannot be obtained by scaling arguments. The (mono-) scaling behaviors of the Fractional Fokker-Planck equation and of its solutions are analysed and a generalization of the Einstein relation for the anomalous diffusion coefficient is obtained. This generalization yields a straightforward physical interpretation of the parameters of Levy stable distributions. Furthermore, with the help of important examples, we show the applicability of the Fractional Fokker-Planck equation in physics.",V. V. Yanovsky; A. V. Chechkin; D. Schertzer; A. V.

astro-ph/0001312v1,"WWhat Heavy Elements in Clusters of Galaxies Tell About Clusters and
  Galaxies","Clusters of galaxies allow a direct estimate of the metallicity and metal production yield on the largest scale so far. The ratio of the total iron mass in the ICM to the total optical luminosity of the cluster (the iron mass-to-light-ratio) is the same for all clusters which ICM is hotter than $\sim 2$ keV, and the elemental proportions (i.e. the [$\alpha$/Fe] ratio) appear to be solar. The simplest interpretation of these evidences is that both the IMF as well the relative contributions of SN types are universal. Currently available abundances in cooler clusters and groups are much more uncertain, possibly due to insufficiently accurate atomic physics data for multi-electron ions, or to the ICM being multi-phase, or to a combination thereof. This uncertainty automatically extends to the reality of radial abundance gradients so far reported in cool clusters. It is emphasized that most metals reside in the ICM rather than in galaxies, which demonstrates that energetic winds operated early in the evolution of massive galaxies, the likely producers of most metals now in the ICM. The ICM metallicity is also used to set a semiempirical constraint of $\sim 0.1$ keV per particle to the ICM {\it preheating} due to supernova driven galactic winds.

astro-ph/0001313v1,Metallicity in damped Lyman-alpha systems: evolution or bias?,"Assuming that damped Lyman-alpha(DLA) systems are galactic discs, we calculate the corresponding evolution of metal abundances. We use detailed multi-zone models of galactic chemical evolution (reproducing successfully the observed properties of disc galaxies) and appropriate statistics (including geometrical propability factors) to calculate the average metallicity as a function of redshift. The results are compatible with available observations, provided that observational biases are taken into account, as suggested by Boisse et al. (1998). In particular, high column density and high metallicity systems are not detected because the light of backround quasars is severely extinguished, while low column density and low metallicity systems are not detectable through their absorption lines by current surveys. We show that these observational constraints lead to a ``no-evolution'' picture for the DLA metallicity, which does not allow to draw strong conclusions about the nature of those systems or about their role in ``cosmic chemical evolution''.",N.

The inverse radiative lifetime of an EHP in a QW \gamma_{r\xi}(\bf{\cal K}_{\perp})\not=0 only under condition {\cal K}_{\perp}\le\omega_\xi n/c, where \hbar\omega_\xi is the EHP energy. It has been shown that \gamma_{r\xi}(\bf{\cal K}_{\perp}) is proportional to H.

astro-ph/0001314v2,"Theory of ""Jitter"" Radiation from Small-Scale Random Magnetic Fields and
  Prompt Emission from Gamma-Ray Burst Shocks","Abridged.-- We demonstrate that the radiation emitted by ultrarelativistic electrons in highly nonuniform, small-scale magnetic fields is different from synchrotron radiation if the electron's transverse deflections in these fields are much smaller than the beaming angle. A quantitative analytical theory of this radiation, which we refer to as jitter radiation, is developed. It is shown that the emergent spectrum is determined by statistical properties of the magnetic field. As an example,we then use the model of a magnetic field in internal shocks of GRBs. The spectral power distribution of radiation produced by the power-law electrons is well described by a sharply broken power-law with indices 1 and -(p-1)/2 and the jitter break frequency is independent of the field strength but depends on the electron density in the ejecta. Since large-scale fields may also be present in the ejecta, we construct a two-component, jitter+synchrotron spectral model of the prompt $\gamma$-ray emission. Quite surprisingly, this model seems to be readily capable of explaining several properties of time-resolved spectra of some GRBs, such as (i) the violation of the constraint on the low-energy spectral index called the synchrotron ``line of death'', (ii) the sharp spectral break at the peak frequency, inconsistent with the broad synchrotron bump, (iii) the evidence for two spectral sub-components, and (iv) possible existence of emission features called ``GRB lines''. We believe these facts strongly support both the existence of small-scale magnetic fields and the proposed radiation mechanism from GRB shocks. As an example, we use the composite model to analyze GRB 910503 which has two spectral peaks.",Mikhail V. Medvedev,astro-ph,astro-ph

  View of the Outer Solar System's Structure Emerges from Numerical Simulations","Using numerical simulations, we examine the structure of a cometary population near a massive planet, such as a giant planet of the Solar system, starting with one-planet approximation (the Sun plus one planet). By studying the distributions of comets in semimajor axis, eccentricity, pericenter, and apocenter distances, we have revealed several interesting features in these distributions. The most remarkable ones include (i) spatial accumulation of comets near the planetary orbit (which we call the `cometary belt') and (ii) avoidance of resonant orbits by comets. Then we abandon one-planet approximation and examine as to how a cometary belt is modified when the influence of all four giant planets is taken into consideration. To this end, we simulate a stationary distribution of comets, which results from the gravitational scattering of the Kuiper belt objects on the four giant planets and accounts for the effects of mean motion resonances. Accounting for the influence of four giant planets makes the cometary belts overlapping, but nevertheless keeping almost all their basic features found in one-planet approximation. In particular, the belts maintain the gaps in the (a,e)- and (a,i)-space similar to the Kirkwood gaps in the main asteroid belt. We conclude that the large-scale structure of the Solar system is featured by the four cometary belts expected to contain 20-30 millions of scattered comets, and only a tiny fraction of them is currently visible as Jupiter-, Saturn-, etc. family comets.",Leonid M.

astro-ph/0001320v1,MACS: The evolution and properties of massive clusters of galaxies,"We present first results from the MAssive Cluster Survey (MACS), a new large-scale X-ray survey designed to find and characterize very massive, distant clusters of galaxies. Based on X-ray detections in the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, MACS aims to compile a sample of more than 200 X-ray luminous clusters at z>0.3, about 50 times the number of EMSS clusters in the same redshift and luminosity range. The MACS sample is uniquely suited to investigate cluster evolution at redshifts and luminosities poorly sampled by all existing surveys.   At the time of writing the MACS sample comprises 41 clusters with measured redshifts of 0.3<z<0.56 and X-ray luminosities in excess of 6 10^44 erg/s (0.1-2.4 keV). This early sample is thus already twice as large as the high-z, high-luminosity subsets of the EMSS, BCS, and REFLEX cluster samples taken together. An additional 85 MACS clusters with photometric redshifts z>0.3 are scheduled for spectroscopic observation.   From a preliminary analysis of a statistically well defined subsample of the 25 X-ray brightest MACS clusters we conclude tentatively that negative evolution is not significant at the highest X-ray luminosities (Lx>10^45 erg/s) out to redshifts of z~0.4.

Then we discuss Kharzeev-Levin pomeron model \cite{KL}, based on ladder-type diagrams with $scalar$ resonances (scalar $\pi\pi$ or $\sigma$ and the scalar glueball $G_0$). This channel is truly unique, because instanton-induced attractive gg interaction \cite{Shu_82} leads to unusually small sizes and strong coupling constants of these states, supplemented by unusually large mass scale, $M_0\approx 4 GeV$, of the transition boundary to the perturbative regime. As pomeron is a small-size object by itself, these resonances may play a special role in its dynamics. Furthermore, we use more realistic description of the scalar gluonic spectral density without free parameters, and slightly modify the model to get correct chiral limit. We conclude that the non-perturbative part of the scalar contribution to the soft pomeron intercept is $\Delta = >.05\pm 0.015$, with comparable contributions from both $\sigma$ and $G_0$.",E. V.

Its optical depth is, however, significantly smaller than that expected from the dust extinction toward the background $L$-band emission region ($A_{\rm V}$ $\sim$ 150 mag). We argue that the most likely explanation for the small optical depth is that the obscuring dust exists so close to the central engine that a temperature gradient occurs. Our calculation confirms that the small optical depth and the spectral energy distribution at 3--30 $\mu$m can be quantitatively reproduced by this explanation. Combining this picture with the huge AGN luminosity, the emission properties of Cygnus A are consistent with those of a type 2 quasar, that is, a highly luminous AGN that is highly obscured ($A_{\rm V}$ $>$ 50 mag) by a dusty torus with an inner radius of $<$10 pc, and not by $>$ a few 100 pc scale dust in the host galaxy.",Masatoshi Imanishi; Shiro Ueno,astro-ph,astro-ph

Observational evidence previously published supporting the model, such as emission line asymmetry and a high frequency of redshifted absorption components, are considered. We also discuss the relation between different line forming regions and search for good accretion rate indicators.   In this work we confirm several important points of the models, such as the correlation between accretion and outflow, broad emission components that are mostly central or slightly blueshifted and only the occasional presence of redshifted absorption. We also show, however, that the broad emission components supposedly formed in the magnetospheric accretion flow only partially support the models. Unlike the predictions, they are sometimes redshifted, and are mostly found to be symmetric. The published theoretical profiles do not have a strong resemblance to our observed ones.

We show quantitatively that the detection of this drop, which is marked by a corresponding fall in the number counts of faint galaxies, should become feasible over the coming decade with the Next Generation Space Telescope.",Rennan Barkana; Abraham Loeb,astro-ph,astro-ph
astro-ph/0001324v1,Observing the effects of strong gravity with future X-ray missions,"Spectroscopy of the broad iron iron with ASCA and BeppoSAX has up opened the innermost regions of accreting black hole systems to detailed study. In this contribution, I discuss how observations with future X-ray missions will extend these studies and all us to observationally address issues which are currently only in the realm of the theorists. In particular, high-throughput spectroscopy with XMM and, eventually, Constellation-X will allow the full diagnostic power of iron line variability to be realized. Instabilities of the inner accretion flow, the geometry of the variable X-ray source, and the black hole mass and spin will all be open to study. Eventually, X-ray interferometry will allow direct imaging of the black hole region in nearby active galaxies, thereby providing the ultimate probe of black hole astrophysics.",C. S.

cond-mat/0001254v2,d_{x^2-y^2} pairing of composite excitations in the 2D Hubbard model,"We report on a strong coupling approach (on-site Coulomb repulsion, U larger than the nearest-neighbour hopping energy |t|) to the Hubbard model. Starting from the Hubbard operators which diagonalize the interaction term, we generate a hierarchy of composite operators from the equations of motion. Using the Hubbard operators as a basis, we are able to compute the associated Green functions including the anomalous Green functions which describe pair formation. We show explicitly that these anomalous Green functions are non-zero in the d_{x^2-y^2} channel; however, the entities that pair up are not single electron-like particles but rather composite excitations (which we call cexons) made out of an electron and a hole on nearest-neighbour sites. Cexons are fermionic in nature as they have spin 1/2 and also have unit charge. Our calculations of the chemical potential reveal that negative compressibility in the 2D Hubbard model and composite excitation pairing are intimately connected, namely, the larger the negative compressibility, the larger the pairing amplitude. Our observation of negative compressibility in the under-doped regime is consistent with phase segregation or stripe formation in the normal state. While pairing ameliorates the negative compresssibility, it does not eliminate it entirely. In addition, we find that the anomalous correlation functions are particle-hole symmetric and exhibit a maximum at a doping level of roughly 10% as measured from half-filling. For U=8|t|, the onset temperature for pair formation is 0.02|t|.",Tudor D. Stanescu; Ivar Martin; Philip Phillips,cond-mat,cond-mat
hep-th/0001112v2,A Cosmological Mechanism for Stabilizing Moduli,"In this paper, we show how the generic coupling of moduli to the kinetic energy of ordinary matter fields results in a cosmological mechanism that influences the evolution and stability of moduli. As an example, we reconsider the problem of stabilizing the dilaton in a non-perturbative potential induced by gaugino condensates. A well-known difficulty is that the potential is so steep that the dilaton field tends to overrun the correct minimum and to evolve to an observationally unacceptable vacuum. We show that the dilaton coupling to the thermal energy of matter fields produces a natural mechanism for gently relaxing the dilaton field into the correct minimum of the potential without fine-tuning of initial conditions. The same mechanism is potentially relevant for stabilizing other moduli fields.",Greg Huey; Paul J. Steinhardt; Burt A. Ovrut; Daniel Waldram,hep-th,hep-th; astro-ph; hep-ph
astro-ph/0001328v2,Oxygen Absorption in Cooling Flows,"The inhomogeneous cooling flow scenario predicts the existence of large quantities of gas in massive elliptical galaxies, groups, and clusters that have cooled and dropped out of the flow. Using spatially resolved, deprojected X-ray spectra from the ROSAT PSPC we have detected strong absorption over energies ~0.4-0.8 keV intrinsic to the central ~1 arcmin of the galaxy, NGC 1399, the group, NGC 5044, and the cluster, A1795. These systems have amongst the largest nearby cooling flows in their respective classes and low Galactic columns. Since no excess absorption is indicated for energies below ~0.4 keV the most reasonable model for the absorber is warm, collisionally ionized gas with T=10^{5-6} K where ionized states of oxygen provide most of the absorption. Attributing the absorption only to ionized gas reconciles the large columns of cold H and He inferred from Einstein and ASCA with the lack of such columns inferred from ROSAT, and also is consistent with the negligible atomic and molecular H inferred from HI, and CO observations of cooling flows. The prediction of warm ionized gas as the product of mass drop-out in these and other cooling flows can be verified by Chandra, XMM, and ASTRO-E.",David A. Buote,astro-ph,astro-ph

This could greatly improve on existing analyses of neutrino interactions and also lead to new and important analysis topics including, for example, precise determinations of the CKM matrix elements |Vub| and |Vcb|. The potential of such general purpose detectors is illustrated with reference to a detector, presented previously in reference hep-ex/9907033, that is structured around a novel and compact vertexing and tracking neutrino target comprising a stack of CCD pixel devices. Design ideas and prospects are also discussed for two types of specialized detectors: (i) polarized targets filled with polarized solid protium-deuterium (HD), for unique and powerful studies of the nucleon's spin structure, and (ii) Fully active liquid tracking targets with masses of several tonnes for precise determinations of the weak mixing angle, from the total cross-section for neutrino-electron scattering.

astro-ph/0001329v2,Iron Gradients in Cooling Flow Galaxies and Groups,"Previous studies of the Fe abundances in the hot gas of galaxies and groups have reported conflicting results with most studies finding very sub-solar Fe abundances that disagree with standard theory. To investigate the possible role of Fe abundance gradients on these measurements we present deprojection analysis of the ROSAT PSPC data of 10 of the brightest cooling flow galaxies and groups. The PSPC allows for spatially resolved spectral analysis on a half-arcminute scale, and interesting constraints on both the temperatures and Fe abundances are possible because the ~1 keV temperatures of these systems are well matched to the bandpass of the PSPC. In 9 out of 10 systems we find clear evidence that the Fe abundance decreases with increasing radius: Z_Fe ~1 solar - (several) solar within the central radial bin (r < ~10 kpc) which decreases to Z_Fe ~0.5 solar at the largest radii examined (r ~50-100 kpc). The Fe abundances (and temperatures) are consistent with the average values for these systems that we obtained in our previous analyses of the ASCA data using multitemperature models which confirms that previous inferences of very sub-solar Fe abundances from ASCA arise from the incorrect assumption of isothermal gas and not the presence of Fe abundance gradients. We discuss why this ``Fe Bias'' affects much more seriously the measurements of Z_Fe from ASCA data than from ROSAT data. We show that the Fe abundance profiles for these galaxies and groups are consistent with a gas-dynamical model where the gas is enriched by stellar ejecta and supernovae in the ``solar supernova proportion'', the stars formed with a Galactic IMF, and the gas is diluted by mixing with primordial gas at large radii.",David A.

  breaking in full QCD","A detailed study is made of four dimensional SU(2) gauge theory with static adjoint ``quarks'' in the context of string breaking. A tadpole-improved action is used to do simulations on lattices with coarse spatial spacings $a_s$, allowing the static potential to be probed at large separations at a dramatically reduced computational cost. Highly anisotropic lattices are used, with fine temporal spacings $a_t$, in order to assess the behavior of the time-dependent effective potentials. The lattice spacings are determined from the potentials for quarks in the fundamental representation. Simulations of the Wilson loop in the adjoint representation are done, and the energies of magnetic and electric ``gluelumps'' (adjoint quark-gluon bound states) are calculated, which set the energy scale for string breaking. Correlators of gauge-fixed static quark propagators, without a connecting string of spatial links, are analyzed. Correlation functions of gluelump pairs are also considered; similar correlators have recently been proposed for observing string breaking in full QCD and other models. A thorough discussion of the relevance of Wilson loops over other operators for studies of string breaking is presented, using the simulation results presented here to support a number of new arguments.",Karn Kallio; Howard D.

We consider the unit spheres $SH^0_J(M, L^N)$ in the spaces $H^0_J(M, L^N)$, which we equip with natural inner products. Our purpose is to show that, in a probabilistic sense, almost holomorphic sections behave like holomorphic sections as $N \to \infty$. Our first main result is that almost all sequences of sections $s_N \in SH^0_J(M, L^N)$ are `asymptotically holomorphic' in the Donaldson-Auroux sense that $||s_N||_{\infty}/||s_N||_{2} = O(\sqrt{\log N})$, $||\bar{\partial} s_N||_{\infty}/||s_N||_{2} = O(\sqrt{\log N})$ and $||\partial s_N||_{\infty}/||s_N||_{2} = O(\sqrt{N \log N})$. Our second main result concerns the joint probability distribution of the random variables $s_N(z^p),\ \nabla s_N(z^p)$, $1\le p\le n$, for $n$ distinct points $z^1,..., z^n$ in a neighborhood of a point $P_0\in M$. We show that this joint distribution has a universal scaling limit about $P_0$ as $N \to \infty$. In particular, the limit is precisely the same as in the complex holomorphic case. Our methods involve near-diagonal scaling asymptotics of the Szeg\""o projector $\Pi_N$ onto $H^0_J(M, L^N)$, which also yields proofs of symplectic analogues of the Kodaira embedding theorem and Tian asymptotic isometry theorem.",Bernard Shiffman; Steve Zelditch,math.SG,math.SG; math-ph; math.CV; math.MP; math.PR; 53C15

This means that the phonons in High-T$_c$ superconductor have the strong interaction between themselves like to gluons in the QCD. At the experimental level this means that in High-T$_c$ superconductor exists the nonlinear sound waves. It is possible that the existence of the strong phonon-phonon interaction leads to the confinement of phonons into a phonon tube (PT) stretched between two Cooper electrons like a hypothesized flux tube between quark and antiquark in the QCD. The flux tube in the QCD brings to a very strong interaction between quark-antiquark, the similar situation can be in the High-T$_c$ superconductor: the presence of the PT can essentially increase the binding energy for the Cooper pair. In the first rough approximation the PT can be approximated as a nonrelativistic string with Cooper electrons at the ends. The BCS theory with such potential term is considered.

In the adiabatic limit, it is shown that the wave function of the total system formed by the quantum system plus the large system can be factorized as an entangled state with correlation between adiabatic quantum states and quasi-classical motion configurations of the large system. In association with a novel viewpoint about quantum measurement, which has been directly verified by most recent experiments [e.g, S.

The ratio of the number of observed to expected events is $ 0.57 \pm0.05_{stat} \pm0.06_{syst} \pm0.14_{theor}$ with an angular distribution similar to that expected from the Bartol atmospheric neutrino flux. The second is a mixed sample of internally produced downward-going muons and externally produced upward-going muons stopping inside the detector. These two subsamples are selected by topological criteria; the lack of timing information makes it impossible to distinguish stopping from downgoing muons.

This is exemplified by the exact analysis of the spherical model in any dimension D>2, and by numerical simulations on the two-dimensional Ising model. We show in particular that, for $1\ll s$ (waiting time) $\ll t$ (observation time), the fluctuation-dissipation ratio possesses a non-trivial limit value $X_\infty$, which appears as a dimensionless amplitude ratio, and is therefore a novel universal characteristic of non-equilibrium critical dynamics.

Using this property we solve recurrence relations for two-loop massless vertex diagrams, with arbitrary numerators and integer powers of propagators in the case when two legs are on the light cone, by reducing the problem to the well-known solution of the corresponding recurrence relations for massless three-loop propagator diagrams with specific boundary conditions.",P.

It is based on the evaluation of the heavy-quark condensate within this model by making use of the world-line formalism and equating the obtained result to the one following directly from the QCD Lagrangian. This yields a certain relation between D^{nonpert.}(0) and D_1^{nonpert.}(0), which is further compared with an analogous relation between these quantities known from the existing lattice data. Such a comparison leads to the conclusion that at the distances smaller than the correlation length of the vacuum, Gaussian Ansatz is more suitable than the exponential one.",Dmitri Antonov,hep-ph,hep-ph

  of magnetohydrodynamics turbulence","The problem of anomalous scaling in magnetohydrodynamics turbulence is considered within the framework of the kinematic approximation, in the presence of a large-scale background magnetic field. The velocity field is Gaussian, $\delta$-correlated in time, and scales with a positive exponent $\xi$. Explicit inertial-range expressions for the magnetic correlation functions are obtained; they are represented by superpositions of power laws with non-universal amplitudes and universal (independent of the anisotropy and forcing) anomalous exponents. The complete set of anomalous exponents for the pair correlation function is found non-perturbatively, in any space dimension $d$, using the zero-mode technique. For higher-order correlation functions, the anomalous exponents are calculated to $O(\xi)$ using the renormalization group. The exponents exhibit a hierarchy related to the degree of anisotropy; the leading contributions to the even correlation functions are given by the exponents from the isotropic shell, in agreement with the idea of restored small-scale isotropy. Conversely, the small-scale anisotropy reveals itself in the odd correlation functions : the skewness factor is slowly decreasing going down to small scales and higher odd dimensionless ratios (hyperskewness etc.) dramatically increase, thus diverging in the $r\to 0$ limit.",N.

This behaviour can be eliminated in the two-point function for the traceless part of this field if one chooses the Gupta-Bleuler vacuum.

  dynamical electron correlations","We formulate a fully self-consistent, microscopic model to study the retardation and correlation effects of the barrier within a Josephson junction. The junction is described by a series of planes, with electronic correlation included through a local self energy for each plane. We calculate current-phase relationships for various junctions, which include non-magnetic impurities in the barrier region, or an interfacial scattering potential. Our results indicate that the linear response of the supercurrent to phase across the barrier region is a good, but not exact indicator of the critical current. Our calculations of the local density of states show the current-carrying Andreev bound states and their energy evolution with the phase difference across the junction.   We calculate the figure of merit for a Josephson junction, which is the product of the critical current, Ic, and the normal state resistance, R(N), for junctions with different barrier materials. The normal state resistance is calculated using the Kubo formula, for a system with zero current flow and no superconducting order. Semiclassical calculations would predict that these two quantities are determined by the transmission probabilities of electrons in such a way that the product is constant for a given superconductor at fixed temperature. Our self-consistent solutions for different types of barrier indicate that this is not the case.

Our code includes radiative cooling of gases, star formation, energy feedback from stars including stellar winds and supernovae, and chemical enrichment by stars. We assume that, in the collapsing galaxy, isothermal cold clouds form through thermal condensations and become proto-globular clouds. We calculate the size of proto-globular clouds by solving the linearized equations for perturbation. We compute the evolution of the inner region of the proto-cloud with our SPH code for various initial radius and initial composition of gases. When the initial gases contain no heavy elements, the evolution of proto-clouds sensitively depends on the initial radius. For a smaller initial radius, the initial star burst is so intense that the subsequent star formation occurs in the central regions to form a dense star cluster as massive as the globular cluster. When the initial gases contain some heavy elements, the metallicity of gases affects the evolution and the final stellar mass. If the initial radius of the proto-globular clouds was relatively large, the formation of a star cluster as massive as the globular clusters requires the initial metallicity as high as [Fe/H] $\geq -2$.

We have fitted stellar templates to the continuum, allowing us to account for all the stellar features and hence detect even faint gas excitation emission lines, including 8 and 11 H_2 lines in the SW and NE nuclei respectively. Population diagrams for the excited H_2 molecules indicate that most of the 1-0S(1) in each of the nuclei has a thermal origin. We discuss this with reference to the observed morphologies, especially that of the 1-0S(1) line. In particular, the core of 1-0S(1) in the NE nucleus is more compact than the 2um continuum; while in the SW nucleus the 1-0S(1) is significantly offset by 500pc from the continuum (and other) emission. Lastly we address the issue of the region midway between the two nuclei, where previously a strong source of radio continuum has been observed.

astro-ph/0001327v1,The spectra and energies of classical double radio lobes,"We compare two temporal properties of classical double radio sources: i) radiative lifetimes of synchrotron-emitting particles and ii) dynamical source ages. We discuss how these can be quite discrepant from one another, rendering use of the traditional spectral ageing method inappropriate: we contend that spectral ages give meaningful estimates of dynamical ages only when these ages are << 10^7 years. In juxtaposing the fleeting radiative lifetimes with source ages which are significantly longer, a refinement of the paradigm for radio source evolution is required. The changing spectra along lobes are explained, not predominantly by synchrotron ageing but, by gentle gradients in a magnetic field mediated by a low-gamma matrix which illuminates an energy-distribution of particles, controlled largely by classical synchrotron loss in the high magnetic field of the hotspot. The energy in the particles is an order of magnitude higher than that inferred from the minimum-energy estimate, implying that the jet-power is of the same order as the accretion luminosity produced by the quasar central engine. This refined paradigm points to a resolution of the findings of Rudnick et al (1994) and Katz-Stone & Rudnick (1994) that both the Jaffe-Perola and Kardashev-Pacholczyk model spectra are invariably poor descriptions of the curved spectral shape of lobe emission, and indeed that for Cygnus A all regions of the lobes are characterised by a `universal spectrum'.

  element","The concept of the space (space-time) of the formless finite fundamental elements (FFFE) is suggested. This space can be defined as a set of coverings of the continual space by non-overlapping simply connected regions of any form and arbitrary sizes with some probability measure. The average sizes of each fundamental element are equal to the fundamental length. This definition enables to describe correctly the passage from the space of the formless finite fundamental elements to the continual space in the limit of zero value of the fundamental length. FFFE space-time functional integral construction is suggested. A wave function of a separate FFFE and the overall wave function of a manifold are introduced. It is shown that many other constructions of the discrete space-time (the Regge coverings, the lattice space-time etc.) are the special cases of this space-time. A vacuum action problem is analyzed. One term of this action is proportional to the volume of a fundamental element. It is possible to direct the way for this term to yield the Nambu-Goto action in consideration the string as one-dimensional excitation of a number of FFFEs. Fermionic and bosonic fields in the space-time of FFFEs are excited states of elements. Space-time supersymmetry leads to supposition that the maximal possible number of fermionic excitations at one FFFE is equal to the number of elements in all space-time.

Rev. Lett. {\bf 83}, 5369 (1999)\} and showed that compositional order enhances the magnitude of magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) of Co$_{0.5}$Pt$_{0.5}$ alloy by some two orders of magnitude as well as affecting the equilibrium magnetization direction. Here we describe our scheme in detail and present an in-depth study of the effect by demonstrating its Fermi surface origin. In Co$_{0.25}$Pt$_{0.75}$ alloy we find that the perfect $ L1_2 $ structure has a very small MAE whereas imposition of directional order enhances the MAE by two orders of magnitude. We also present the effect of lattice distortion (tetragonalization) on the MAE on the same footing and find that in the Co$_{0.5}$Pt$_{0.5}$ alloy it accounts for only about 20% of the observed MAE, thus confirming that compositional order is the major player in the enhancement of MAE. We also examine the directional chemical order that can be produced by magnetic annealing within the same framework. We extract a Fermi surface mechanism for the effect in an explicit study of permalloy.

If f is monotone, we show furthermore that only O(T^3) queries are needed. Previously, Beals et al. (1998) showed that if a quantum computer can evaluate f with bounded error using T queries in the worst case, then a deterministic classical computer can evaluate f using O(T^6) queries in the worst case, or O(T^4) if f is monotone.

In the limit $p=0$ (without desorption), our model reduces to the well studied Takayasu model where the steady-state single site mass distribution has a power law tail $P(m)\sim m^{-\tau}$ for large mass. We show that varying the desorption rate $p$ induces a nonequilibrium phase transition in all dimensions. For fixed $q$, there is a critical $p_c(q)$ such that if $p<p_c(q)$, the steady state mass distribution, $P(m)\sim m^{-\tau}$ for large $m$ as in the Takayasu case. For $p=p_c(q)$, we find $P(m)\sim m^{-\tau_c}$ where $\tau_c$ is a new exponent, while for $p>p_c(q)$, $P(m)\sim \exp(-m/m^*)$ for large $m$.

The scattering matrix is the quantum analogue of the classical evolution operator on the graph. For the energy-averaged spectral form factor of the scattering matrix we have recently derived an exact combinatorial expression. It is based on a sum over families of periodic orbits which so far could only be performed in special graphs. Here we present a simple algorithm implementing this summation for any graph. Our results are in excellent agreement with direct numerical simulations for various graphs. Moreover we extend our previous notion of an ensemble of graphs by considering ensemble averages over random boundary conditions imposed at the vertices. We show numerically that the corresponding form factor follows the predictions of random-matrix theory when the number of vertices is large---even when all bond lengths are degenerate. The corresponding combinatorial sum has a structure similar to the one obtained previously by performing an energy average under the assumption of incommensurate bond lengths.,Tsampikos Kottos; Holger Schanz,nlin.CD,nlin.CD

Charged kaons were identified in the central tracking detector using their specific energy loss in the drift chamber gas. The correlation function was studied in two-jet events using a double ratio, formed by the number of like-sign pairs normalised by a reference sample in the data, divided by the same ratio in a Monte Carlo simulation. The enhancement at small values of the four-momentum difference of the pair was parametrised using a Gaussian function. The parameters of the Bose-Einstein correlations were measured to be lambda = 0.82+-0.22(+0.17,-0.12) for the strength and R0 = 0.56+-0.08(+0.08,-0.06) fm for the kaon source radius, where the first errors are statistical and the second systematic.

In such a case, the dual solution is a similar black hole spacetime endowed with a global monopole charge. Here, we extend this formalism to obtain solutions dual to the static, spherically symmetric solutions of two different scalar-tensor gravity theories. In particular, we first study the duals of the charged black hole solutions of a four-dimensional low-energy effective action of heterotic string theory. Next, we study dual of the Xanthopoulos-Zannias solution in Brans-Dicke theory, which contains a naked singularity.

Results are described for three specific cases motivated by a specific heterotic string model and by phenomenological considerations, including cases in which all three families have different couplings, and those in which the first two families, but not the third, have the same couplings.

This ""Pulse Scale Conjecture"" is confirmed here between energy channels of the dominant pulse in GRB 930214c (BATSE trigger 2193), the single most fluent single-pulsed GRB that occurred before May 1998. Furthermore, pulses are hypothesized to start at the same time independent of energy. This ""Pulse Start Conjecture"" is also confirmed in GRB 930214c. Analysis of GRB 930214c also shows that, in general, higher energy channels show shorter temporal scale factors. Over the energy range 100 KeV - 1 MeV, it is found that the temporal scale factors between a pulse measured at different energies are related to that energy by a power law, possibly indicating a simple relativistic mechanism is at work. To test robustness, the Pulse Start and Pulse Scale Conjectures were also tested on the four next most fluent single-pulse GRBs. Three of the four clearly passed, with a second smaller pulse possibly confounding the discrepant test.

The WFPC2 imagery clearly differentiates extended nebular Halpha emission from that of the compact core. Faint Object Spectrograph (FOS) observations provide a full set of optical and UV data (1200-6800 Angstroms).   These spectral data sample the innermost region (0.""86 x 0.""86 ~ 82pc x 82pc) and exclude the extended Halpha emission seen in the WFPC2 image. The derived emission line fluxes allow a detailed analysis of the physical conditions within the nucleus. The measured flux ratio for Halpha/Hbeta, F{Halpha}/F{Hbeta}=4.53, indicates substantial intrinsic reddening, E(B-V)=0.42, for the nuclear nebular emission. This is the first finding of a large extinction of the nuclear emission line fluxes in NGC 1052. If the central ionizing continuum is assumed to be attenuated by a comparable amount, then the emission line fluxes can be reproduced well by a simple photoionization model using a central power law continuum source with a spectral index of alpha = -1.2 as deduced from the observed flux distribution. A multi-density, dusty gas gives the best fit to the observed emission line spectrum.

The same calculation is done within standard reference background subtraction.   The dilaton-dependent conformal anomaly from d3 and d5 gauged SGs is calculated using AdS/CFT correspondence. Such anomaly should correspond to two- and four-dimensional dual quantum field theory which is classically (not exactly) conformally invariant, respectively. The candidate c-functions from d3 and d5 SGs are suggested. These c-functions which have fixed points in asymptoticaly AdS region are expressed in terms of dilatonic potential and they are positively defined and monotonic for number of potentials.",Shin'ichi Nojiri; Sergei D.

astro-ph/0001330v2,"ROSAT Evidence for Intrinsic Oxygen Absorption in Cooling Flow Galaxies
  and Groups","Using spatially resolved, deprojected ROSAT PSPC spectra of 10 of the brightest cooling flow galaxies and groups with low Galactic column densities we have detected intrinsic absorption over energies ~0.4-0.8 keV in half of the sample. Since no intrinsic absorption is indicated for energies below ~0.4 keV, the most reasonable model for the absorber is collisionally ionized gas at temperatures T=10^{5-6} K with most of the absorption arising from ionized states of oxygen but with a significant contribution from carbon and nitrogen. The soft X-ray emission of this warm gas can explain the sub-Galactic column densities of cold gas inferred within the central regions of most of the systems. Attributing the absorption to ionized gas reconciles the large columns of cold H and He inferred from EINSTEIN and ASCA with the lack of such columns inferred from ROSAT. Within the central ~10-20 kpc, where the constraints are most secure, the estimated mass of the ionized absorber is consistent with most (perhaps all) of the matter deposited by a cooling flow over the lifetime of the flow. Since the warm absorber produces no significant H or He absorption the large absorber masses are consistent with the negligible atomic and molecular H inferred from HI and CO observations of cooling flows. It is also found that if T > ~2x10^5 K then the optical and UV emission implied by the warm gas does not violate published constraints. Finally, we discuss how the prediction of warm ionized gas as the product of mass drop-out in these and other cooling flows can be verified with new CHANDRA and XMM observations. (Abridged)",David A.

  Particles","The ambiguity in the definition for the mass and width of relativistic resonances is discussed, in particular for the case of the Z-boson. This ambiguity can be removed by requiring that a resonance's width $\Gamma$ (defined by a Breit-Wigner lineshape) and lifetime $\tau$ (defined by the exponential law) always and exactly fulfill the relation $\Gamma = \hbar/\tau$. To justify this one needs relativistic Gamow vectors which in turn define the resonance's mass M_R as the real part of the square root $\rm{Re}\sqrt{s_R}$ of the S-matrix pole position s_R. For the Z-boson this means that $M_R \approx M_Z - 26{MeV}$ and $\Gamma_R \approx \Gamma_Z-1.2{MeV}$ where M_Z and $\Gamma_Z$ are the values reported in the particle data tables.",Arno R. Bohm; N. L.

In contrast to this quantum engineering, the most abstract reaches of theoretical physics has spawned topological models having a finite dimensional internal state space with no natural tensor product structure and in which the evolution of the state is discrete, H = 0. These are called topological quantum filed theories (TQFTs). These exotic physical systems are proved to be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer. The conclusion is two-fold: 1. TQFTs cannot be used to define a model of computation stronger than the usual quantum model BQP. 2. TQFTs provide a radically different way of looking at quantum computation.

  Telescope - Detection of H$α$ Ionization Cones of a Powerful Radio
  Galaxy","We report on infrared imaging observations of the z=2.429 radio galaxy B3 0731+438 with the Subaru telescope. The images were taken with the K'-band filter and the 2.25 um narrow-band filter to examine the structure and properties of the Ha+[N II] 6548,6583 emission-line components. The Ha+[N II] emission-line image shows biconical lobes with an extent of 40 kpc, which are aligned with the radio axis. The rest-frame equivalent widths of the emission lines at these cones are as large as 1100 AA, and can be well explained by a gas-cloud model photoionized by power-law continuum radiation. The isotropic ionizing photon luminosity necessary to ionize the hydrogen gas in these cones amounts to 1e57(photons/s), which is larger than that in the majority of radio-loud QSOs. From these results, we propose that the Ha alignment effect in this object is produced by biconical gas clouds, which are swept up by the passage of radio jets, and are ionized by strong UV radiation from a hidden AGN. The continuum image consists of two components, a stellar-like point source and an extended diffuse galaxy. These are supposed to be a type-2 AGN and its host galaxy. The SED is fitted by a combination of spectra of a reddened dust-scattered AGN and an instantaneous starburst population of 500 Myr old.

astro-ph/0001348v1,"Non-Gaussianity and the recovery of the mass power spectrum from the
  Ly$α$ forest","We investigate the effect of non-Gaussianity on the reconstruction of the initial mass field from the Ly$\alpha$ forest. We show that the transmitted flux of QSO absorption spectra are highly non-Gaussian in terms of the statistics, the kurtosis spectrum and scale-scale correlation. These non-Gaussianities can not be completely removed by the conventional algorithm of Gaussianization, and the scale-scale correlations are largely retained in the mass field recovered by the Gaussian mapping. Therefore, the mass power spectrum recovered by the conventional algorithm is systematically lower than the initial mass spectrum on scales at which the local scale-scale correlation is substantial. To reduce the non-Gaussian contamination, we present two methods. The first is to perform the Gaussianization scale-by-scale using the discrete wavelet transform (DWT) decomposition. We show that the non-Gaussian features of the Ly$\alpha$ forest basically will no longer exist in the scale-by-scale Gaussianized mass field. The second method is to choose a proper orthonormal basis (representation) to suppress the effect of the non-Gaussian correlations. In the quasilinear regime of cosmic structure formation, the DWT power spectrum is efficient for suppressing the non-Gaussian contamination.

hep-th/0001124v2,"Lorentzian and Euclidean Quantum Gravity - Analytical and Numerical
  Results","We review some recent attempts to extract information about the nature of quantum gravity, with and without matter, by quantum field theoretical methods. More specifically, we work within a covariant lattice approach where the individual space-time geometries are constructed from fundamental simplicial building blocks, and the path integral over geometries is approximated by summing over a class of piece-wise linear geometries. This method of ``dynamical triangulations'' is very powerful in 2d, where the regularized theory can be solved explicitly, and gives us more insights into the quantum nature of 2d space-time than continuum methods are presently able to provide. It also allows us to establish an explicit relation between the Lorentzian- and Euclidean-signature quantum theories. Analogous regularized gravitational models can be set up in higher dimensions. Some analytic tools exist to study their state sums, but, unlike in 2d, no complete analytic solutions have yet been constructed. However, a great advantage of our approach is the fact that it is well-suited for numerical simulations. In the second part of this review we describe the relevant Monte Carlo techniques, as well as some of the physical results that have been obtained from the simulations of Euclidean gravity. We also explain why the Lorentzian version of dynamical triangulations is a promising candidate for a non-perturbative theory of quantum gravity.",J. Ambjorn; J. Jurkiewicz; R.

astro-ph/0001350v1,Gas Streams and Spiral Structure in the Milky Way,"The observed gas dynamics in the Milky Way can only be explained by a bar in the galactic center. Such a bar is directly visible in the near-IR maps of the bulge, where it causes a distinctive asymmetric light distribution pattern. Another large-scale structure is the grand-design 4-arm spiral pattern, most clearly observed in the spatial distribution of molecular gas and HII-regions.   In order to model the observed gas flow structure, we constructed a model for the stellar mass distribution. For the inner 5 $\kpc$ we used the 3D deprojected near-IR light distribution, as observed by the COBE/DIRBE experiment, and added an analytical disk model outside the box as well as a halo model. With this frozen mass distribution, we computed the stationary gas flow for various deprojection parameters and pattern speeds. For all reasonable parameter choices, we obtain a 4-armed spiral pattern, which can be matched to the observed spiral arms.   In the bar region, our model can explain the non-circular motion visible in the terminal velocity curve as well as part of the forbidden velocities. Inside the corotation, we also find 4 spiral arms, the nearest arm corresponds to the 3-kpc-arm, although only qualitatively. The missing southern 3-kpc-arm at the far end of the galaxy is explained by running parallel to another arm. Close to the center, we find gas on circular orbits forming a disk. Such a disk has been observed in emission of the CS molecule, however only part of the disk appears to be occupied by dense enough gas to be traced by CS.

However due to ac-Stark associated quantum noise the signal-to-noise ratio of EIT-based magnetometers attains a maximum value at a certain laser intensity. This value is independent on the quantum statistics of the light and defines a standard quantum limit of sensitivity.

The result is used to obtain a partial solution to the tangential Hilbert 16th problem. We establish upper bounds for the number of zeros of arbitrary Abelian integrals on a positive distance from the critical locus. Under the additional assumption that the critical values of the Hamiltonian are distant from each other (after a proper normalization), we were able to majorize the number of all (real and complex) zeros.   In the second part of the paper an equivariant formulation of the above problem is discussed and relationships between spread of critical values and non-homogeneity of uni- and bivariate complex polynomials are studied.",D.

From the analysis of the free energy for a finite number of particles, we find that the specific heat of this ideal spinor gas as a function of temperature has two maxima: one is related to a Schottky anomaly, due to the lifting of the spin degeneracy by the external field, the other maximum is the signature of Bose-Einstein condensation.",L.

  Spaces","The kinetic theory is formulated with respect to anholonomic frames of reference on curved spacetimes. By using the concept of nonlinear connection we develop an approach to modelling locally anisotropic kinetic processes and, in corresponding limits, the relativistic non-equilibrium thermodynamics with local anisotropy. This lead to a unified formulation of the kinetic equations on (pseudo) Riemannian spaces and in various higher dimensional models of Kaluza-Klein type and/or generalized Lagrange and Finsler spaces. The transition rate considered for the locally anisotropic transport equations is related to the differential cross section and spacetime parameters of anisotropy. The equations of states for pressure and energy in locally anisotropic thermodynamics are derived. The obtained general expressions for heat conductivity, shear and volume viscosity coefficients are applied to determine the transport coefficients of cosmic fluids in spacetimes with generic local anisotropy. We emphasize that such locally anisotropic structures are induced also in general relativity if we are modelling physical processes with respect to frames with mixed sets of holonomic and anholonomic basis vectors which naturally admits an associated nonlinear connection structure.",Sergiu I.

We show that a large region of parameter space is consistent with current data if $\Omega_{m0} > 0.15$.

From the background galaxy ellipticities we create two-dimensional maps of the surface mass density of each cluster.

We also measure the one-dimensional radial profiles of the lensing signals and fit these with both isothermal spheres and ""universal"" CDM profiles.

  some comments on traffic flow and a nonequilibrium reentrance transition","We study the steady-state behavior of a driven non-equilibrium lattice gas of hard-core particles with next-nearest-neighbor interaction. We calculate the exact stationary distribution of the periodic system and for a particular line in the phase diagram of the system with open boundaries where particles can enter and leave the system. For repulsive interactions the dynamics can be interpreted as a two-speed model for traffic flow. The exact stationary distribution of the periodic continuous-time system turns out to coincide with that of the asymmetric exclusion process (ASEP) with discrete-time parallel update. However, unlike in the (single-speed) ASEP, the exact flow diagram for the two-speed model resembles in some important features the flow diagram of real traffic. The stationary phase diagram of the open system obtained from Monte Carlo simulations can be understood in terms of a shock moving through the system and an overfeeding effect at the boundaries, thus confirming theoretical predictions of a recently developed general theory of boundary-induced phase transitions. In the case of attractive interaction we observe an unexpected reentrance transition due to boundary effects.",T. Antal; G. M. Schütz,cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.stat-mech
hep-ph/0001212v1,Single-W Production and Fermion-Loop Scheme: Numerical Results,"The single-W production mechanism is synonymous to the electron-positron annihilation into electron, neutrino and a W boson with the outgoing electron lost in a small cone around the beam direction. It requires a Renormalization Scheme that preserves gauge invariance and fermion masses cannot be neglected in the calculation. A recently proposed generalization of the so-called Fermion-Loop scheme is applied to the evaluation of observables at LEP 2 energies. Single-W processes are dominated by a regime of low momentum transfer of the outgoing electron and any high-energy Renormalization Scheme fails to give the correct description of the scale. The Fermion-Loop scheme automatically converts all couplings of the theory into couplings that are running at the appropriate scale. Therefore, in addition to represent the only scheme fully justified on a field-theoretical basis, the Fermion-Loop is the best starting point to include radiative corrections into single-W production. Numerical results are presented, showing a decrease in the predictions that can be sizeable. There is no naive and overall rescaling of the e.m. coupling constant, in any pragmatic scheme, that can reproduce the Fermion-Loop results, at the requested accuracy, for all configurations and for all kinematical cuts.",G.

For the density profiles of the emitting gas in the models, we use a general power law form calculated for photoionized, photoevaporative flows by Bertoldi (1989). We find that the spatial emission line profiles are dependent on the incident flux, the shape of the ionizing continuum and the elemental abundances. In particular, we find that the peak emissivity of the [SII] and [NII] lines are more sensitive to the elemental abundances than are the total line intensities. The diagnostics obtained from the grid of models can be used in conjunction with high spatial resolution data to infer the properties of ionized interfaces in blister HII regions. As an example, we consider a location at the tip of an ``elephant trunk'' structure in M16 (the Eagle Nebula) and show how narrow band HST-WFPC2 images constrain the HII region properties.

We then derive these descriptions from what we claim are basic properties of any physical theory - i.e. the notion that a quantity in such a theory may be analysed into parts and that the results of this analysis may be treated in languages with an underlying boolean structure. We shall see that in the course of constructing a model of a theory with these properties different indistinguishable possibilities will arise for how the elements of the model may be named, that is to say different possibilities arise for how they can be associated with points from Set. Taking a particular collection of possibilities gives the usual boolean lattice of the propositions of classical physics. Taking all possibilities - in a sense, the set of all things that may be described by physical theories - gives the lattice of quantum mechanical propositions.

The absorbed AGN will suffer severe extinction and therefore, unlike classical QSOs, will not be prominent at optical wavelengths. Most of the accretion power is being absorbed by gas and dust and will have to be reradiated in the FIR/sub-mm band. AGN could therefore contribute a substantial fraction to the recently discovered cosmic FIR/sub-mm background. Here it is shown that a number of high-redshift absorbed X-ray sources selected in the ROSAT Deep Survey of the Lockman Hole have broad-band spectral energy distributions very similar to the local ULIRG NGC6240, lending additional support to the background models for the obscured universe.",Guenther Hasinger,astro-ph,astro-ph

Recent experimental indications in favor of these effects are observed: 1.The correlation of the T-odd one-particle fragmentation functions found by DELPHI in $Z\to 2$-jet decay. Integrated over the fraction of longitudinal and transversal momenta, this correlation is of 1.6% order, which means order of 13% for the analyzing power. 2.A rather large ($\approx10%$) handedness transversal to the production plane observed in the diffractive production of ($\pi^-\pi^+\pi^-$) triples from nuclei by the $40 {\rm GeV/c}$ $\pi^-$--beam. It shows a clear dynamic origin and resembles the single spin asymmetry behavior.   All this makes us hope to use these effects in polarized DIS experiments for transversity measurement.

  Microwave Background Radiation","Measuring the three-point correlators of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) anisotropies could help to get a handle on the level of non-Gaussianity present in the observational datasets and therefore would strongly constrain models of the early Universe. However, typically, the expected non-Gaussian signal is very small. Therefore, one has to face the problem of extracting it from the noise, in particular from the `cosmic variance' noise. For this purpose, one has to construct the best unbiased estimators for the three-point correlators that are needed for concrete detections of non-Gaussian features. In this article, we study this problem for both the CMB third moment and the CMB angular bispectrum.

In practice, however, there are often ambiguities in the construction of orbifolds that are a consequence of the fact that the action of the orbifold elements on degenerate ground states is not unambiguous. We explain that there exists an additional consistency condition, related to the spectrum of D-branes in the theory, which eliminates these ambiguities. For supersymmetric orbifolds this condition turns out to be equivalent to the condition that supersymmetry is unbroken in the twisted sectors, but for non-supersymmetric orbifolds it appears to be a genuinely new consistency condition.",O.

Self-similar scaling also does not hold as rigorously for the three-point function as for the two-point function in the n=-2 simulation, perhaps a manifestation of the finite simulation volume. We suggest that a better understanding of the two- and three-point correlation functions in the nonlinear regime lies in the link to the density profiles of dark matter halos. We demonstrate and quantify how the slopes of the correlation functions are affected by the slope of the halo profiles using simple halo shapes and analytic clustering models.",Chung-Pei Ma; J. N.

For $t=1$, the concept of spontaneous breaking and subsequent restoration of the isospin symmetry turns out to be important. It permits us to describe the proton-neutron pair-correlation within the conventional frame of pairing between like particles. The experimental data are consistent with the presence of a $t=1$ field at low spin in $N\approx Z$ nuclei. For a substantial $t=0$ field, the spectra of even-even and odd-odd $N\approx Z$ nuclei become similar. The possibility of a rotationally induced $ J=1$ pair-field at high spin is considered.",S.

The rate is about 20% smaller than in pure Yang-Mills theory. We also analyze the sphaleron rate in the analytic crossover regime.

The NuTeV detector is a traditional heavy target neutrino detector which consists of an iron/liquid scintillator sampling calorimeter followed by a muon spectrometer. The calorimeter response to hadrons, muons and electrons has been measured in an in situ calibration beam over the energy range from 4.5 to 190 GeV. The small non-linearity of the response to hadrons is compared to the expectation from the measured ratio of responses between electrons and hadrons combined with the energy dependence of the fractional electromagnetic energy deposition in the form of neutral pions in hadronic showers $f_{\pi^{0}}(E_{\pi})$. The predictions use $f_{\pi^{0}}(E_{\pi})$ from the Monte Carlo simulations by GHEISHA, GFLUKA and GCALOR and also from the parameterizations of Wigmans and Groom. In addition, a study based on the NuTeV hadron calibration data of the effectiveness of a thin calorimeter is presented.

Expressions for the interwall tunneling amplitudes between states on neighboring tubes are derived which show the dependence on chiral angles and intratube crystal momenta.

astro-ph/0001363v2,Vorticity Budget of Weak Thermal Convection in Keplerian disks,"By employing the equations of mean-square vorticity (enstrophy) fluctuations in strong shear flows, we demonstrate that unlike energy production of turbulent vorticity in nonrotating shear flows, the turbulent vorticity of weak convection in Keplerian disks cannot gain energy from vortex stretching/tilting by background shear unless the asscoiated Reynolds stresses are negative. This is because the epicyclic motion is an energy sink of the radial component of mean-square turbulent vorticity in Keplerian disks when Reynolds stresses are positive. Consequently, weak convection cannot be self-sustained in Keplerian flows. This agrees with the results implied from the equations of mean-square velocity fluctuations in strong shear flows. Our analysis also sheds light on the explanation of the simulation result in which positive kinetic helicity is produced by the Balbus-Hawley instability in a vertically stratified Keplerian disk. We also comment on the possibility of outward angular momentum transport by strong convection based on azimuthal pressure perturbations and directions of energy cascade.",Pin-Gao Gu,astro-ph,astro-ph

We obtain 3865 bound fine structure levels of Fe V and $1.46 x 10^6$ oscillator strengths, Einstein A-coefficients and line strengths. In addition to the relativistic effects, the intermediate coupling calculations include extensive electron correlation effects that represent the complex configuration interaction (CI).

The bound levels are obtained as solutions of the Breit-Pauli (e + ion) Hamiltonian for each $J\pi$, and are designated according to the `collision' channel quantum numbers. A major task has been the identification of these large number of bound fine structure levels in terms of standard spectroscopic designations. A new scheme, based on the analysis of quantum defects and channel wavefunctions, has been developed.

astro-ph/0001364v2,"New Techniques for Relating Dynamically Close Galaxy Pairs to Merger and
  Accretion Rates : Application to the SSRS2 Redshift Survey","We introduce two new pair statistics, which relate close galaxy pairs to the merger and accretion rates. We demonstrate the importance of correcting these (and other) pair statistics for selection effects related to sample depth and completeness. In particular, we highlight the severe bias that can result from the use of a flux-limited survey. The first statistic, denoted N_c, gives the number of companions per galaxy, within a specified range in absolute magnitude. N_c is directly related to the galaxy merger rate. The second statistic, called L_c, gives the total luminosity in companions, per galaxy. This quantity can be used to investigate the mass accretion rate. Both N_c and L_c are related to the galaxy correlation function and luminosity function in a straightforward manner. We outline techniques which account for various selection effects, and demonstrate the success of this approach using Monte Carlo simulations. If one assumes that clustering is independent of luminosity (which is appropriate for reasonable ranges in luminosity), then these statistics may be applied to flux-limited surveys.   These techniques are applied to a sample of 5426 galaxies in the SSRS2 redshift survey. Using close dynamical pairs, we find N_c(-21<M_B<-18) = 0.0226+/-0.0052 and L_c(-21<M_B<-18) = 0.0216+/-0.0055 10^{10} h^2 L_sun at z=0.015. These are the first secure estimates of low-z close pair statistics. If N_c remains fixed with redshift, simple assumptions imply that ~ 6.6% of present day galaxies with -21<M_B<-18 have undergone mergers since z=1. When applied to redshift surveys of more distant galaxies, these techniques will yield the first robust estimates of evolution in the galaxy merger and accretion rates. [Abridged]",D. R. Patton; R.

astro-ph/0001365v1,Starquake-Induced Glitches in Pulsars,"The neutron star crust is rigid material floating on a neutron-proton liquid core. As the star's spin rate slows, the changing stellar shape stresses the crust and causes fractures. These starquakes may trigger pulsar glitches as well as the jumps in spin-down rate that are observed to persist after some glitches. Earlier studies found that starquakes in spinning-down neutron stars push matter toward the magnetic poles, causing temporary misalignment of the star's spin and angular momentum. After the star relaxes to a new equilibrium orientation, the magnetic poles are closer to the equator, and the magnetic braking torque is increased. The magnitude and sign of the predicted torque changes are in agreement with the observed persistent spin-down offsets. Here we examine the relaxation processes by which the new equilibrium orientation is reached. We find that the neutron superfluid in the inner crust slows as the star's spin realigns with the angular momentum, causing the crust to spin more rapidly. For plausible parameters the time scale and the magnitude of the crust's spin up agree with the giant glitches in the Vela and other pulsars.",Richard I. Epstein; Bennett Link,astro-ph,astro-ph

In these models the non-Gaussianity can be dialed from zero and is assumed to be small. We compute the probability density function for the smoothed dark matter density field and we extend the Press and Schechter approach to mildly non-Gaussian density fields. The abundance of high-redshift objects can be directly related to the non-Gaussianity parameter and thus to the physical processes that generated deviations from the Gaussian behaviour. Even a skewness parameter of order 0.1 implies a dramatic change in the predicted abundance of $z\gap 1$ objects.

A simple numerical argument is presented which suggests that Quantum Spacetime may very well be $infinite$ dimensional. A discussion of the repercusions of this new paradigm in Physics is given. A truly remarkably simple and plausible solution of the cosmological constant problem results from the New Relativity Principle : The cosmological constant is $not$ constant, in the same vein that Energy in Einstein's Special Relativity is observer dependent. Finally, following El Naschie, we argue why the observed D=4 world might just be an $average$ dimension over the infinite possible values of the Quantum Spacetime and why the compactification mechanisms from higher to four dimensions in String theory may not be actually the right way to look at the world at Planck scales.",Carlos Castro,hep-th,hep-th

The X-ray light curves resulting from the thermal response to the glitches are calculated. Only the `spot' case and the `ring' case are considered because the `shell' case does not produce significant modulative X-rays. The magnetic field ($\vec B$) effect, the relativistic light bending effect and the rotational effect on the photons being emitted in a finite region are considered.

It is highly desirable, if possible, to identify a common mathematcal structure among all the ensembles and analyze it to gain information about the ensemble- properties. Our successful search in this direction leads to Calogero Hamiltonian, a one-dimensional quantum hamiltonian with inverse-square interaction, as the common base. This is because both, the eigenvalues of the ensembles, and, a general state of Calogero Hamiltonian, evolve in an analogous way for arbitrary initial conditions.

An ASCA observation of this target unveiled a bright (0.5-10 keV luminosity 3.9 x 10^42 erg/s) and variable source, with minimum observed doubling/halving time scale comprised in the range 30-75 ks. A model composed by a simple power-law, with photon index ~1.8 and an absorption edge, whose threshold energy is consistent with K-shell photoionization of OVII, provides an adequate fit of the spectrum. This suggests that we are observing the emission from the nuclear region through a warm absorber of N_H a few 10^{21}/cm/cm. If it has internal dust with Galactic gas-to-dust ratio, it could explain the lack of broad Hbeta emission, even in the episodic presence of a broad Halpha emission line. Optical spectra obtained over several years show indeed variations in the strength of this broad Halpha component. A distribution of dusty, optically thick matter on spatial scales a few hundreds parsec, which does not intercept the line of sight towards the nucleus, is probably required to account simultaneously for the relative [OIII] luminosity deficit in comparison to the X-rays.

cond-mat/0001308v1,"Glassy properties and localization of interacting electrons in
  two-dimensional systems","We present a computer simulation study of a disordered two-dimensional system of localized interacting electrons at thermal equilibrium. It is shown that the configuration of occupied sites within the Coulomb gap persistently changes at temperatures much less than the gap width. This is accompanied by large time dependent fluctuations of the site energies. The observed thermal equilibration at low temperatures suggests a possible glass transition only at T=0. We interpret the strong fluctuations in the occupation numbers and site energies in terms of the drift of the system between multiple energy minima. The results also imply that interacting electrons may be effectively delocalized within the Coulomb gap. Insulating properties, such as hopping conduction, appear as a result of long equilibration times associated with glassy dynamics. This may shine new light on the relation between the metal-insulator transition and glassy behavior.",D. Menashe; O. Biham; B. D. Laikhtman; A. L.

The behaviour of the SE well spread elementary electric charge had been understood by means of two independent and different in a frequency and size motions. The description of this resultant motion may be done by substitution of the classical Wiener continuous integral with the quantized Feynmam continuous integral. There are possibility to show by means of the existent not only formal but substantial analogy between the quadratic differential wave equation in partial derivatives of Schrodinger and quadratic differential particle equation in partial derivatives of Hamilton-Jacoby that the addition of a kinetic energy of the stochastic harmonic oscillation of some quantized micro particles to the kinetic energy of classical motion of the same micro particles formally determines their wave behaviour.It turns out the stochastic motion of the quantized micro particles powerfully to break up the smooth thin line of the classical motion of the same micro particle in many broad cylindrically spread path. The SE participate in stochastically roughly determined circumferences within different flats and with different radii, with centres which are successively arranjed over short and very disorderly orientated lines.

In the particular case of 2-dimensionally supported, i.e. string type, system in an ordinary 4-dimensional background it is shown how the result of this regularisation is expressible in terms of the worldsheet curvature vector $K^\mu$, and more particularly that (contrary to what was suggested by early work on this subject) for a string of Nambu Goto type the divergent contribution from the dilatonic self action will always be directed oppositely to its axionic counterpart. This makes it possible for the dilatonic and axionic divergences to entirely cancel each other out (so that there is no need of a renormalisation to get rid of ``infinities'') when the relevant coupling coefficents are related by the appropriate proportionality condition provided by the low energy limit of superstring theory.",Brandon Carter,hep-th,hep-th

We compare basic properties of these two surveys and their current status, and add some historical remarks.   The candidate selection procedures of both surveys are described in detail. We evaluate the candidate selection by comparing effective yields (EYs) of the survey techniques for the identification of metal-poor stars. It is found that EY for stars below [Fe/H]=-2.0 in the HES can be up to 80% for stars selected by automatic classification from machine-scanned unwidened plates, whereas in the HK survey, where stars are selected by visual inspection of widened survey plates, the EY is between 11% and 32%, depending on whether a pre-selection based on BV photometry has been applied.   Finally, we describe techniques used for determining stellar parameters of the survey stars by means of moderate resolution follow-up spectroscopy, and additional UBV photometry.

astro-ph/0001379v1,"One-Point Probability Distribution Functions of Supersonic Turbulent
  Flows in Self-Gravitating Media","Turbulence is essential for understanding the structure and dynamics of molecular clouds and star-forming regions. There is a need for adequate tools to describe and characterize the properties of turbulent flows. One-point probability distribution functions (pdf's) of dynamical variables have been suggested as appropriate statistical measures and applied to several observed molecular clouds. However, the interpretation of these data requires comparison with numerical simulations. To address this issue, SPH simulations of driven and decaying, supersonic, turbulent flows with and without self-gravity are presented. In addition, random Gaussian velocity fields are analyzed to estimate the influence of variance effects. To characterize the flow properties, the pdf's of the density, of the line-of-sight velocity centroids, and of the line centroid increments are studied. This is supplemented by a discussion of the dispersion and the kurtosis of the increment pdf's, as well as the spatial distribution of velocity increments for small spatial lags. From the comparison between different models of interstellar turbulence, it follows that the inclusion of self-gravity leads to better agreement with the observed pdf's in molecular clouds. The increment pdf's for small spatial lags become exponential for all considered velocities. However, all the processes considered here lead to non-Gaussian signatures, differences are only gradual, and the analyzed pdf's are in addition projection dependent. It appears therefore very difficult to distinguish between different physical processes on the basis of pdf's only, which limits their applicability for adequately characterizing interstellar turbulence.",Ralf S.

To do so, one considers the given matrix as an observable of a single spin with appropriate length s=(N-1)/2, which can be measured using a generalized Stern-Gerlach apparatus. Then, each run provides one eigenvalue of the observable.

  Threshold","Although nonsingular spacetimes and those containing black holes are qualitatively quite different, there are continuous families of configurations that connect the two.

We show how causally distinct regions emerge as the black hole limit is achieved, even though the measurements made by an external observer vary continuously. We find that near-critical solutions have a naturally defined entropy, despite the absence of a true horizon, and that this has a clear connection with the Hawking-Bekenstein entropy. We find that certain classes of near-critical solutions display naked black hole behavior, although they are not truly black holes at all. Finally, we present a numerical simulation illustrating how an incident pulse of matter can induce the dynamical collapse of a monopole into an extremal black hole.

In this paper we present results from d.c. magnetic susceptibility, specific heat data, inelastic neutron scattering measurements, and crystal field calculations that strongly suggest that (1) the Tb$^{3+}$ ions in Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ possess a moment of approximatively 5$\mu_{\rm B}$, and (2) the ground state $g-$tensor is extremely anisotropic below a temperature of $O(10^0)$K, with Ising-like Tb$^{3+}$ magnetic moments confined to point along a local cubic $<111>$ diagonal (e.g. towards the middle of the tetrahedron). Such a very large easy-axis Ising like anisotropy along a $<111>$ direction dramatically reduces the frustration otherwise present in a Heisenberg pyrochlore antiferromagnet. The results presented herein underpin the conceptual difficulty in understanding the microscopic mechanism(s) responsible for Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$ failing to develop long-range order at a temperature of the order of the paramagnetic Curie-Weiss temperature $\theta_{\rm CW} \approx -10^1$K. We suggest that dipolar interactions and extra perturbative exchange coupling(s)beyond nearest-neighbors may be responsible for the lack of ordering of Tb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$.",M. J. P. Gingras; B.

In particular, the hybrid ruthenate-cuprate compound RuSr_2GdCu_2O_8 is examined on the coexistence of the superconductivity and the ferromagnetism, which has been observed recently. We calculate critical fields of the superconductivity taking into account the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov state in a model with Fermi-surfaces which shapes are similar to those obtained by a band calculation. It is shown that the critical field is enhanced remarkably due to a Fermi-surface effect, and can be high enough to make the coexistence possible in a microscopic scale.

We confirm that silicon is tetrahedrally coordinated by nitrogen, and boron is trigonally planar coordinated by nitrogen. Furthermore we find that the coordination of nitrogen by the cations is also trigonally planar. Additionally our results suggest that a significant structural property of these materials is a heterogenity on a lengthscale of about 0.5nm.

We find a branch of collective modes, in addition to the spin waves and Stoner continuum which occur in metallic ferromagnets, and predict that the low-temperature spin stiffness is independent of the strength of the exchange coupling between magnetic ions and itinerant carriers.

In the most interesting case of the adsorption onto a substrate of low dielectric constant (such as a lipid membrane or a mica sheet) the condensed counterions are not always released as the PE approaches the substrate, because of the major importance of the image charge effect. For the adsorption onto a surface with freely moving charges, the image charge effect becomes less important and full release is often expected.",Pierre Sens; Jean-Francois Joanny,cond-mat.soft,cond-mat.soft

The data are dominated by J^{PC} = 0^{-+} partial waves consistent with observation of the eta(1295) and the eta(1440).

Assuming all attributes to be distributed logNormally, Mukherjee et al. (1998) analyzed these same data using a statistical cluster analysis. Utilizing the logarithmic values for T90 duration, total fluence, and hardness ratio HR321 their results showed the instances formed three classes. Class I contained long/bright/intermediate bursts, class II consisted of short/faint/hard bursts and class III was represented by intermediate/intermediate/soft bursts.   When ESX was presented with these data and restricted to forming a small number of classes, the two classes found by previous standard techniques were determined. However, when ESX was allowed to form more than two classes, four classes were created. One of the four classes contained a majority of short bursts, a second class consisted of mostly intermediate bursts, and the final two classes were subsets of the Class I (long) bursts determined by Mukherjee et al.

It suggests, in particular, to compute the symplectic form on the reduced space by a fiber integral of the symplectic form on the original space. This approach is then applied to a class of systems with loop group symmetry. The chiral anomaly of the loop group action spoils the first class character of the constraints but not their closure. Proceeding along the general lines described above, we obtain a 2-form from a fiber (path)integral. This form is not closed as a relict of the anomaly.

These states generalize charge- and spin-density-wave states, in which s-wave particle-hole pairs condense. We show that the p-wave spin-singlet state of this type has Peierls ordering, while the d-wave spin-singlet state is the staggered flux state. We discuss model Hamiltonians which favor p-wave and d-wave density wave order. There are analogous orderings for pure spin models, which generalize spin-Peierls order. The spin-triplet density wave states are accompanied by spin-1 Goldstone bosons, but these excitations do not contribute to the spin-spin correlation function. Hence, they must be detected with NQR or Raman scattering experiments. Depending on the geometry and topology of the Fermi surface, these states may admit gapless fermionic excitations. As the Fermi surface geometry is changed, these excitations disappear at a transition which is third-order in mean-field theory.

  description and chromospheric age-metallicity relation","The age-metallicity relation of the solar neighbourhood is studied using a sample of 552 late-type dwarfs. This sample was built from the intersection of photometric catalogues with chromospheric activity surveys of the Mount Wilson group. For these stars, metallicities were estimated from uvby data, and ages were calculated from their chromospheric emission levels using a new metallicity-dependent chromospheric activity-age relation developed by Rocha-Pinto & Maciel (1998). A careful estimate of the errors in the chromospheric age is made. The errors in the chromospheric indices are shown to include partially the effects of the stellar magnetic cycles, although a detailed treatment of this error is still beyond our knowledge. It is shown that the results are not affected by the presence of unresolved binaries in the sample. We derive an age-metallicity relation which confirms the mean trend found by previous workers. The mean metallicity shows a slow, steady increase with time, amounting at least 0.56 dex in 15 Gyr. The initial metallicity of the disk is around -0.70 dex, in agreement with the G dwarf metallicity distribution. According to our data, the intrinsic cosmic dispersion in metal abundances is around 0.13 dex, a factor of two smaller than that found by Edvardsson et al. (1993). We show that chromospheric ages are compatible with isochrone ages, within the expected errors, so that the difference in the scatter cannot be caused by the accuracy of our ages and metallicities. This reinforces some suggestions that the Edvarsson et al.'s sample is not suitable to the determination of the age-metallicity relation.",H. J. Rocha-Pinto; W. J.

We show that the disk of our Galaxy has experienced enhanced episodes of star formation at 0-1 Gyr, 2-5 Gyr and 7-9 Gyr ago, although the reality of the latter burst is still uncertain. The star sample birthsites are distributed over a very large range of distances because of orbital diffusion, and so give an estimate of the global star formation rate. These results are compared with the metal-enrichment rate, given by the age-metallicity relation, with the expected epochs of close encounters between our Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds, and with previous determinations of the star formation history. Simulations are used to examine the age-dependent smearing of the star formation history due to age uncertainties, and the broadening of the recovered features, as well as to measure the probability level that the history derived to be produced by statistical fluctuations of a constant star formation history.

A goal of this study is the measurement of the color excess, E_{B-I}, which is a sensitive indicator of interstellar or intergalactic dust which could affect recent cosmological measurements from high-redshift SNe Ia.

astro-ph/0001385v2,Do wavelets really detect non-Gaussianity in the 4-year COBE data?,"We investigate the detection of non-Gaussianity in the 4-year COBE data reported by Pando, Valls-Gabaud & Fang (1998), using a technique based on the discrete wavelet transform. Their analysis was performed on the two DMR faces centred on the North and South Galactic poles respectively, using the Daubechies 4 wavelet basis. We show that these results depend critically on the orientation of the data, and so should be treated with caution. For two distinct orientations of the data, we calculate unbiased estimates of the skewness, kurtosis and scale-scale correlation of the corresponding wavelet coefficients in all of the available scale domains of the transform. We obtain several detections of non-Gaussianity in the DMR-DSMB map at greater than the 99 per cent confidence level, but most of these occur on pixel-pixel scales and are therefore not cosmological in origin. Indeed, after removing all multipoles beyond $\ell = 40$ from the COBE maps, only one robust detection remains. Moreover, using Monte-Carlo simulations, we find that the probability of obtaining such a detection by chance is 0.59. We repeat the analysis for the 53+90 GHz coadded COBE map. In this case, after removing $\ell > 40$ multipoles, two non-Gaussian detections at the 99 per cent level remain. Nevertheless, again using Monte-Carlo simulations, we find that the probability of obtaining two such detections by chance is 0.28. Thus, we conclude the wavelet technique does {\em not} yield strong evidence for non-Gaussianity of cosmological origin in the 4-year COBE data.",P. Mukherjee; M. P. Hobson; A. N.

  Feige 24 Using Hubble Space Telescope Fine Guidance Sensor 3: White Dwarf
  Radius and Component Mass Estimates","With HST FGS 3 we have determined a parallax for the white dwarf - M dwarf interacting binary, Feige 24. The white dwarf (DA) component has an effective temperature, T_eff of approximately 56,000 K degrees. A weighted average with past parallax determinations (pi_abs = 14.6 +- 0.4 milliseconds of arc) narrows the range of possible radius values, compared to past estimates. We obtain R_DA = 0.0185 +- 0.0008 R_solar with uncertainty in the temperature and bolometric correction the dominant contributors to the error. FGS photometry provides a light curve entirely consistent with reflection effects. A recently refined model Mass-Luminosity Relation (Baraffe et al. 1998) for low mass stars provides a mass estimate for the M dwarf companion, M_dM = 0.37 +- 0.20 M_solar, where the mass range is due to metallicity and age uncertainties. Radial velocities from Vennes and Thorstensen (1994) provide a mass ratio from which we obtain M_DA = 0.49+0.19-0.05 ~ M_solar. Independently, our radius and recent log_g determinations yield 0.44 < M_DA < 0.47 M_solar. In each case the minimum DA mass is that derived by Vennes & Thorstensen from their radial velocities and Keplerian circular orbits with inclination <= 90 degrees.

  fitting distance scale, subdwarfs ages and the value of Delta Y/DeltaZ","The effect of atomic diffusion on the Main Sequence (MS) of metal-poor low mass stars is investigated. Since diffusion alters the stellar surface chemical abundances with respect to their initial values, one must ensure - by calibrating the initial chemical composition of the theoretical models - that the surface abundances of the models match the observed ones of the stellar population under scrutiny. Since the observed surface abundances of subdwarfs are different from the initial ones due to the effect of diffusion, while the globular clusters stellar abundances are measured in Red Giants, which have practically recovered their initial abundances after the dredge-up, the isochrones to be employed for studying globular clusters and Halo subdwarfs with the same observational value of [Fe/H] are different and do not coincide. We find, however,that the current MS-fitting distances derived from HIPPARCOS subdwarfs using colour corrections from standard isochrones are basically unaltered when diffusion is taken properly into account; on the other hand, the absolute ages, the age dispersion, the age-metallicity relation for Halo subdwarfs, as well as the value of the helium enrichment ratio Delta Y/Delta Z obtained from the width of the empirical Halo subdwarfs MS, are all significantly modified when the properly calibrated isochrones with diffusion are used.",M.

astro-ph/0001389v1,External Shock Model for Gamma-Ray Bursts during the Prompt Phase,"The hard X-ray and gamma-ray phenomenology of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) can be explained by an external shock model where a single relativistic blast wave interacts with the surrounding medium. Besides reproducing the generic spectral behavior of GRB profiles, the external shock model provides quantitative fits to the peak flux distribution, the > 1 s t_{50} duration distribution, and the distribution of the peaks E_pk of the vF_v spectra of GRBs measured with BATSE. The apparent paradox between a relativistic beaming scenario and the empirical finding that E_pk values are preferentially measured within the triggering range of a GRB detector is resolved by this model when blast wave physics and detector triggering criteria are taken into account. Some surprising implications follow, namely that the fireball event rate is ~1 per 10^4 years per Milky Way galaxy for unbeamed sources, and proportionally more if fireball outflows are collimated. This is ~ 3 orders of magnitude larger than normally quoted. Most of the clean and dirty fireball transients are undetected due to telescope sensitivity and design limitations.   Strongly variable GRB time histories with good radiative efficiencies are possible because of the strongly enhanced emissions when a blast wave interacts with density inhomogeneities located nearly along the line-of-sight to the observer.

The University of Michigan Survey","Objective-prism surveys which select galaxies on the basis of line-emission are extremely effective at detecting low-luminosity galaxies and constitute some of the deepest available samples of dwarfs. In this study, we confirm that emission-line galaxies (ELGs) in the University of Michigan (UM) objective-prism survey (MacAlpine et al. 1977-1981) are reliable tracers of large-scale structure, and utilize the depth of the samples to examine the spatial distribution of low-luminosity (M$_{B} > $ -18.0) dwarfs relative to higher luminosity giant galaxies (M$_{B} \leq$ -18.0) in the Updated Zwicky Catalogue (Falco et al. 1999). New spectroscopic data are presented for 26 UM survey objects. We analyze the relative clustering properties of the overall starbursting ELG and normal galaxy populations, using nearest neighbor and correlation function statistics. This allows us to determine whether the activity in ELGs is primarily caused by gravitational interactions. We conclude that galaxy-galaxy encounters are not the sole cause of activity in ELGs since ELGs tend to be more isolated and are more often found in the voids when compared to their normal galaxy counterparts. Furthermore, statistical analyses performed on low-luminosity dwarf ELGs show that the dwarfs are less clustered when compared to their non-active giant neighbors. The UM dwarf samples have greater percentages of nearest neighbor separations at large values and lower correlation function amplitudes relative to the UZC giant galaxy samples. These results are consistent with the expectations of galaxy biasing.",Janice C. Lee; John J. Salzer; Jessica Rosenberg; Daniel Law,astro-ph,astro-ph

These transitions involve the transformation of the five-brane into a ``small instanton'' on the Calabi-Yau space at the boundary brane, followed by the ``smoothing out'' of the small instanton into a holomorphic vector bundle. Small instanton phase transitions change the number of families, the gauge group or both on the boundary brane, depending upon whether a base component, fiber component or both components of the five-brane class are involved in the transition.

The frequencies of these features were recently shown to be comparable to fundamental general relativistic frequencies of perturbed test-particle orbits near the compact objects. In this paper we propose a dynamical model for producing modulations in the inner disk properties at these characteristic frequencies. We postulate that a transition radius exists in the accretion disk close to the compact object and investigate its response to a broad spectrum of density fluctuations. We find that the transition radius acts as a low band-pass filter with a broadband response that is constant at frequencies lower than the inverse radial drift timescale and decreases above it as the inverse of the frequency. Moreover, the response shows strong resonances at frequencies nearly equal to the orbital, periastron-precession, and nodal-precession frequencies, thereby accounting for the observed power-density spectra of accreting compact objects and the correlations between their characteristic frequencies.",Dimitrios Psaltis; Colin Norman,astro-ph,astro-ph

astro-ph/0001394v1,Radio Properties of z>4 Optically-Selected Quasars,"We report on two programs to address differential evolution between the radio-loud and radio-quiet quasar populations at high (z>4) redshift. Both programs entail studying the radio properties of optically-selected quasars. First, we have observed 32 optically-selected, high-redshift (z>4) quasars with the VLA at 6 cm (5 GHz). These sources comprise a statistically complete and well-understood sample. We detect four quasars above our 3-sigma limit of ~0.15 mJy, which is sufficiently sensitive to detect all radio-loud quasars at the probed redshift range. Second, we have correlated 134 z>4 quasars, comprising all such sources that we are aware of as of mid-1999, with FIRST and NVSS. These two recent 1.4 GHz VLA sky surveys reach 3-sigma limits of approximately 0.6 mJy and 1.4 mJy respectively. We identify a total of 15 z>4 quasars, of which six were not previously known to be radio-loud. The depth of these surveys does not reach the radio-loud/radio-quiet demarcation luminosity density (L(1.4 GHz) = 10^32.5 h(50)^(-2) ergs/s/Hz) at the redshift range considered; this correlation therefore only provides a lower limit to the radio-loud fraction of quasars at high-redshift. The two programs together identify eight new radio-loud quasars at z>4, a significant increase over the seven currently in the published literature. We find no evidence for radio-loud fraction depending on optical luminosity for -25 > M_B > -28 at z~2, or for -26>M_B>-28 at z>4. Our results also show no evolution in the radio-loud fraction between z~2 and z>4 (-26>M_B>-28).",Daniel Stern; S. G. Djorgovski; R. A. Perley; Reinaldo R. deCarvalho; J. V. Wall,astro-ph,astro-ph

  emission","We have performed an extensive hydrodynamical parameter study of starburst-driven galactic winds, motivated by the latest observation data on the best-studied starburst galaxy M82. We study how the wind dynamics, morphology and X-ray emission depend on the host galaxy's ISM distribution, starburst star formation history and strength, and presence and distribution of mass-loading by dense clouds. We find that the soft X-ray emission from galactic winds comes from low filling factor (ff < 2 per cent) gas, which contains only a small fraction (f < 10 per cent) of the mass and energy of the wind, irrespective of whether the wind models are strongly mass-loaded or not. X-ray observations of galactic winds therefore do not directly probe the gas that contains the majority of the energy, mass or metal-enriched gas in the outflow. The soft X-ray emission comes from gas at a wide range different temperatures and densities. Estimates of the physical properties of the hot gas in starburst galaxies, based on fitting the standard simple spectral models to existing X-ray spectra, should therefore be treated with extreme suspicion. The majority of the thermal and kinetic energy of these winds is in a volume filling hot, T approx 10^7 K, component which is extremely difficult to probe observationally due to its low density and hence low emissivity. Most of the total energy is in the kinetic energy of this hot gas, a factor which must be taken into account when attempting to constrain wind energetics observationally. We also find that galactic winds are efficient at transporting large amounts of energy out of the host galaxy, in contrast to their inefficiency at transporting mass out of star-forming galaxies.

astro-ph/0001398v1,"The star formation history as a function of type: constraints from
  galaxy counts","Deep galaxy counts are among the best constraints on the cosmic star formation history (SFH) of galaxies. The evolution of the star formation activity is followed on a wide range of redshifts (0< z < 4) covering most of the history of the Universe. Two incompatible interpretations of the observations are currently competing. After applying star formation rate (SFR) conversion factors to the CFRS, Halpha or ISO samples, many authors conclude to a strong increase (~ a factor 10) of the SFR from z=0 to z=1. They also find some evidence for a peak at z~1 and for a rapid decrease at higher redshifts. On the other side, the Hawaii deep surveys favor only a mild increase between z=0 and 1 (Cowie et al., 1996, 1999). To understand the reason for these discrepant interpretations, we consider three classes of galaxies: E/S0, Sa-Sb-Sbc, Sc-Sd-Im and bursting dwarfs. We use the new version of our evolutionary synthesis code, PEGASE which takes into account metallicity and dust effects. The main results are: i) Late-type galaxies contribute significantly to the local SFR, especially bursting dwarfs (Fioc and Rocca-Volmerange, 1999). Because of that, the cosmic SFR can not decrease by a factor 10 from z=0 to 1. This is in agreement with Cowie's result. ii) The SFR of intermediate-type galaxies has strongly decreased since z=1. Though the decrease is less than what find Lilly et al., 1996, this suggests that the CFRS and Halpha surveys are dominated by such bright early spirals. iii) The contribution of early-type galaxies increases rapidly from z=1 to their redshift of formation (> 2-3 for cosmological reasons). Their intense star formation rates at high-z give strong constraints on early ionization phases, primeval populations or metal enrichments.(abridged)",Brigitte Rocca-Volmerange; Michel Fioc,astro-ph,astro-ph

Since the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) traces the structures in the low-redshift universe, we can gain additional insights into the physics of the low-redshift universe by cross-correlating microwave background maps with template maps produced from the SDSS. We present a formalism for cross-correlating data from the Microwave Anisotropy Probe (MAP) with the Sloan Survey for the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect, the Integrated Sachs-Wolfe (ISW) effect, and weak lensing. This formalism is used to compute the signal-to-noise for cross-correlating these effects with various classes of tracer objects from the SDSS. It is found that the anticipated samples of SDSS quasars and galaxies with photometrically-determined redshifts would be good tracers for cross-correlating with the CMB. We find that the SZ-galaxy cross-correlation would give good constraints on pressure fluctuations in supercluster-scale gas.

Initial conditions obtained from a self-screened parton cascade calculation and, for comparison, from the HIJING model are used. Compared to an equilibrated plasma at the same initial energy density, taken from the self-screened parton cascade, a moderate suppression of the photon yield by a factor of one to five depending on the collision energy and the photon momentum is observed.

astro-ph/0001400v1,Collapsars,"A variety of stellar explosions powered by black hole accretion are discussed. All involve the failure of neutrino energy deposition to launch a strong supernova explosion. A key quantity which determines the type of high energy transient produced is the ratio of the engine operation time, $\rm t_{engine}$, to the time for the explosion to break out of the stellar surface, $\rm t_{bo}$. Stars with sufficient angular momentum produce collapsars -- black holes accreting rapidly through a disk -- in their centers. Collapsars can occur in stars with a wide range of radii depending on the amount of pre-collapse mass loss. The stellar radius and jet properties determine the degree of beaming of the explosion. In some cases the stellar envelope serves to focus the explosion to narrow beaming angles. The baryon loading of various models for classical GRBs formed in massive stars is examined and the consequences are explored. For $\rm t_{engine} > t_{bo}$, highly relativistic outflow is possible and classical GRBs accompanied by supernovae can be produced. In other cases hyper-energetic, asymmetric supernovae are produced. Longer GRBs ($t \gtaprx 100 \s$) can be produced by fallback following a weak neutrino-driven supernova explosion.",Andrew MacFadyen,astro-ph,astro-ph

In this paper, analytic and numerical methods are used to examine harmonic slicings of Kasner and Gowdy cosmological spacetimes. It is shown that in general the slicings are prevented from covering the whole of the spacetimes by the appearance of coordinate singularities. As well as limiting the maximum running times of numerical simulations, the coordinate singularities can lead to features being produced in numerically evolved solutions which must be distinguished from genuine physical effects.",S.

Here we present a pulsed NMR Knight shift (K) study of $^{77}$Se measured simultaneously with transport in pressurized (TMTSF)$_2$PF$_6$. The Knight shift is linearly dependent on the electron spin susceptibility $\chi_s$, and is therefore a direct measure of the spin polarization in the superconducting state. For a singlet superconductor, the spin contribution to the Knight shift, K$_s$, falls rapidly on cooling through the transition. The present experiments indicate no observable change in K between the metallic and superconducting states, and thus strongly support the hypothesis of triplet p-wave superconductivity in (TMTSF)$_2$PF$_6$.",I.

astro-ph/0001401v1,Power Density Spectra of GRBs,"Power density spectra (PDSs) of long gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) provide useful information on GRBs, indicating their self-similar temporal structure. The best power-law PDSs are displayed by the longest bursts (T_90>100 s) in which the range of self-similar time scales covers more than 2 decades. Shorter bursts have apparent PDS slopes more strongly affected by statistical fluctuations. The underlying power law can then be reproduced with high accuracy by averaging the PDSs for a large sample of bursts. This power law has a slope approximately equal to -5/3 and a sharp break at about 1 Hz.   The power-law PDS provides a new sensitive tool for studies of GRBs. In particular, we calculate the PDSs of bright bursts in separate energy channels. The PDS flattens in the hard channel (h\nu>300 keV) and steepens in the soft channel (h\nu<50 keV), while the PDS of bolometric light curves approximately follows the -5/3 law.   We then study dim bursts and compare them to the bright ones. We find a strong correlation between the burst brightness and the PDS slope. This correlation shows that the bursts are far from being standard candles and dim bursts should be intrinsically weak. The time dilation of dim bursts is probably related to physical processes occurring in the burst rather than to a cosmological redshift.",A. M. Beloborodov; B. E. Stern; R. Svensson,astro-ph,astro-ph

The most remarkable structures are depressions in the X-ray surface brightness, $\sim 25-35$ kpc diameter, that are coincident with Hydra A's radio lobes. The depressions are nearly devoid of X-ray-emitting gas, and there is no evidence for shock-heated gas surrounding the radio lobes. We suggest the gas within the surface brightness depressions was displaced as the radio lobes expanded subsonically, leaving cavities in the hot atmosphere. The gas temperature declines from 4 keV at 70 kpc to 3 keV in the inner 20 kpc of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG), and the cooling time of the gas is $\sim 600$ Myr in the inner 10 kpc. These properties are consistent with the presence of a $\sim 34 \msunyr$ cooling flow within a 70 kpc radius.

astro-ph/0001404v1,ROSAT observations of X-ray emission from planetary nebulae,"We have searched the entire ROSAT archive for useful observations to study X-ray emission from Galactic planetary nebulae (PNs). The search yields a sample of 63 PNs, which we call the ROSAT PN sample. About 20-25% of this sample show X-ray emission; these include 13 definite detections and three possible detections (at a 2-sigma level). All X-ray sources in these PNs are concentrated near the central stars. Only A 30, BD+30 3639, and NGC 6543 are marginally resolved by the ROSAT instruments. Three types of X-ray spectra are seen in PNs. Type 1 consists of only soft X-ray emission (<0.5 keV), peaks at 0.1-0.2 keV, and can be fitted by blackbody models at temperatures 1-2 10^5 K. Type 2 consists of harder X-ray emission, peaks at >0.5 keV, and can be fitted by thin plasma emission models at temperatures of a few 10^6 K. Type 3 is a composite of a bright Type 1 component and a fainter Type 2 component. Unresolved soft sources with Type 1 spectra or the soft component of Type 3 spectra are most likely photospheric emission from the hot central stars. Absorption cross sections are large for these soft-energy photons; therefore, only large, tenuous, evolved PNs with hot central stars and small absorption column densities have been detected. The origin of hard X-ray emission from PNs is uncertain. PNs with Type 2 spectra are small, dense, young nebulae with relatively cool (<<10^5 K) central stars, while PNs with Type 3 X-ray spectra are large, tenuous, evolved nebulae with hot central stars. The hard X-ray luminosities are also different between these two types of PNs, indicating perhaps different origins of their hard X-ray emission.

  nonlinear Schrödinger equation","We consider in detail the self-trapping of a soliton from a wave pulse that passes from a defocussing region into a focussing one in a spatially inhomogeneous nonlinear waveguide, described by a nonlinear Schrodinger equation in which the dispersion coefficient changes its sign from normal to anomalous. The model has direct applications to dispersion-decreasing nonlinear optical fibers, and to natural waveguides for internal waves in the ocean. It is found that, depending on the (conserved) energy and (nonconserved) mass of the initial pulse, four qualitatively different outcomes of the pulse transformation are possible: decay into radiation; self-trapping into a single soliton; formation of a breather; and formation of a pair of counterpropagating solitons. A corresponding chart is drawn on a parametric plane, which demonstrates some unexpected features. In particular, it is found that any kind of soliton(s) (including the breather and counterpropagating pair) eventually decays into pure radiation with the increase of the energy, the initial mass being kept constant. It is also noteworthy that a virtually direct transition from a single soliton into a pair of symmetric counterpropagating ones seems possible. An explanation for these features is proposed. In two cases when analytical approximations apply, viz., a simple perturbation theory for broad initial pulses, or the variational approximation for narrow ones, comparison with the direct simulations shows reasonable agreement.",S.

  external electric and arbitrary magnetic fields","The connected system of Boltzman equations for the interacting system of electrons, positrons and photons in high external electric E and arbitrary magnetic H fields is solved. The consideration is made under the conditions of arbitrary heating and the mutual drag of carriers and photons.   The non-stationary and non-uniform distribution function (DF) of photons for the all considered cases is obtained. It is shown that the DF of photons have the stationary limit for the drift velocities $(\overset{\to }\to{u}\overset{\to}\to{q}/\hbar \omega_q) <1$ and becomes exponentially grown by the time for the drift velocities $(\overset{\to}\to{u}\overset{\to}\to{q}/\hbar \omega_q) \geq 1$. It is shown that the mutual drag of carriers and photons leads to the formation of ''quasi-particles''\_ the ''electron dressed by photons'' and ''positron dressed by photons'', i.e. the mutual drag plays the role of the dressing mechanism of carriers and leads to the renormalization of the mass and frequency of photons.   As a result of analyses of the phenomena of connected by the mutual drag system of carriers and photons we receive some fundamental results: a) the finiteness of the mass of photon (i.e. the rest mass of photons do not equal to zero); b) reality of takhyons as a quasi-particles with the real mass in amplifying system (or regime); c) identity of the mechanism of relativity and the Doppler effect which coincides with the renormalization of frequency or mass as a result of the mutual drag of carriers and photons at external field (force). These conclusions were received as a result of the fact that the relativistic factor enters to the expressions of the DF of photons and other physical expressions in the first order in the form $[ 1-(u^2/c^2) ] ^{-1}$, instead the $[ 1-(u^2/c^2) ] ^{-1/2}$ in Einstein theory. It is shown that the relativistic effect of deceleration of time really taking place for the relaxation time of carriers or for the life time of carriers, or for the period of electromagnetic oscillations.

astro-ph/0001403v1,Properties of disk galaxies in a hierarchical formation scenario,"We used galaxy evolutionary models in a hierarchical inside-out formation scenario to study the origin of the main properties and correlations of disk galaxies. We found that most of these properties and correlations are the result of three (cosmological) initial factors and their dispersions: the virial mass, the halo mass aggregation history (MAH), and the angular momentum given through the spin parameter \lambda. The MAH determines mainly the halo structure and the color indexes while \lambda determines mainly the surface brightness and the bulge-to-disk ratio. We calculated star formation (SF) using a gravitational instability criterion and a self-regulation mechanism in the turbulent ISM. The efficiency of SF in this model is almost independent from the mass. We show that the luminosity-dependent dust absorption empirically determined by Wang & Heckman explains the observed color-magnitude and color Tully-Fisher (TF) relations without the necessity of introducing a mass-dependent SF efficiency. The disks in centrifugal equilibrium form within growing CDM halos with a gas accretion rate proportional to the MAH. The disks present exponential surface density and brightness profiles, negative radial color index gradients, and nearly flat rotation curves. We also calculated the secular formation of a bulge due to gravitational instabilities in the stellar disk. The intensive properties of our models agree with the observational data and the trends of the Hubble sequence are reproduced. The predicted infrared TF and luminosity-radius relations also agree with observations. The main shortcomings of our inside-out hierarchical models are the excessive radial color gradients and the dark halo dominion in the rotation curve decompositions.",V. Avila-Reese; C.

More interestingly, this hypothesis may be tested in future colliders by detecting lepton number violating decays of the lightest supersymmetric particle. Here, we present a comprehensive analysis for the determination of sneutrino vacuum expectation values from the one-loop effective scalar potential, and also for the one-loop renormalization of neutrino masses and mixing. Applying our results to theories with gauge mediated supersymmetry breaking, we discuss the effects of the one-loop corrections and how the realistic neutrino mass matrices arise.",Eung Jin Chun,hep-ph,hep-ph
cond-mat/0001336v1,Dynamics of aeolian sand ripples,"We analyze theoretically the dynamics of aeolian sand ripples. In order to put the study in the context we first review existing models. We argue on the local character of sand ripple formation. Using a hydrodynamical model we derive a nonlinear equation for the sand profile. We show how the hydrodynamical model may be modified to recover the missing terms that are dictated by symmetries. The symmetry and conservation arguments are powerful in that the form of the equation is model-independent. We then present an extensive numerical and analytical analysis of the generic sand ripple equation. We find that at the initial stage the wavelength of the ripple is that corresponding to the linearly most dangerous mode. At later stages the profile undergoes a coarsening process leading to a significant increase of the wavelength. We find that including the next higher order nonlinear term in the equation, leads naturally to a saturation of the local slope. We analyze both analytically and numerically the coarsening stage, in terms of a dynamical exponent for the mean wavelength increase. We discuss some future lines of investigations.",Z. Csahok; C.

In the presence of vortices, the neutron scattering cross-section shows clear signatures of not only the fluctuations in the superconducting order parameter \psi, but also the modulation of the phase of \psi due to vortices.

The 0.3-40 keV spectrum is unusually complex and cannot be fit by any of the standard models applied to other LMXRB. At least two components are required. One component has a shape consistent with that expected from the Comptonization of an input soft (Wein) spectrum while the other, contributing ~40% of the 1-10 keV flux, is consistent with being a blackbody. In addition, there is a ``dip'' in the spectrum which can be modeled by a 1.33 +0.05 -0.11 keV absorption edge with an optical depth, tau, of 0.28 +/- 0.06. If the same model is fit to ASCA Solid-State Imaging Spectrometer spectra obtained in 1993 and 1996, then reasonable fits are also obtained, with a similar absorption feature required. The nature of this feature is highly uncertain; its energy corresponds to the K-edges of highly ionized Ne x and neutral Mg, or to an L-edge of moderately ionized Fe. Surprisingly, no strong (tau > 0.05) Fe-K or (tau > 0.18) O-K edges are visible.

The proposed nonadditive conditional entropy is classically nonnegative but can be negative in the quantum context, indicating its utility for characterizing quantum entanglement. A criterion deduced from it for separability of density matrices for validity of local realism is examined in detail by employing a bipartite spin-1/2 system.

cond-mat/0001340v1,"Ordering Dynamics of Heisenberg Spins with Torque: Crossover, Spinwaves
  and Defects","We study the effect of a torque induced by the local molecular field on the phase ordering dynamics of the Heisenberg model when the total magnetization is conserved. The torque drives the zero-temperature ordering dynamics to a new fixed point, characterized by exponents $z=2$ and $\lambda \approx 5$. This `torque-driven' fixed point is approached at times such that $g^2 t\gg 1$, where $g$ is the strength of the torque. All physical quantities, like the domain size $L(t)$ and the equal and unequal time correlation functions obey a crossover scaling form over the entire range of $g$. An attempt to understand this crossover behavior from the approximate Gaussian Closure Scheme fails completely, implying that the dynamics at late times cannot be understood from the dynamics of defects alone. We provide convincing arguments that the spin configurations can be decomposed in terms of defects and spin-waves which interact with each other even at late times. In the absence of the torque term, the spin waves decay faster, but even so we find that the Gaussian closure scheme is inconsistent. In the latter case the inconsistency may be remedied by including corrections to a simple gaussian distribution. For completeness we include a discussion of the ordering dynamics at $T_c$, where the torque is shown to be relevant, with exponents $z=4-\epsilon/2$ and $\lambda = d$ (where $\epsilon = 6-d$). We show to all orders in perturbation theory that $\lambda=d$ as a consequence of the conservation law.",Jayajit Das; Madan Rao,cond-mat.stat-mech,cond-mat.stat-mech

cond-mat/0001342v1,Structure and rheology of binary mixtures in shear flow,"Results are presented for the phase separation process of a binary mixture subject to an uniform shear flow quenched from a disordered to a homogeneous ordered phase. The kinetics of the process is described in the context of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation with an external velocity term. The large-N approximation is used to study the evolution of the model in the presence of a stationary flow and in the case of an oscillating shear.   For stationary flow we show that the structure factor obeys a generalized dynamical scaling. The domains grow with different typical lengthscales $R_x$ and $R_\perp$ respectively in the flow direction and perpendicularly to it. In the scaling regime $R_\perp \sim t^{\alpha_\perp}$ and $R_x \sim \gamma t^{\alpha_x}$ (with logarithmic corrections), $\gamma $ being the shear rate, with $\alpha_x=5/4$ and $\alpha_\perp =1/4$. The excess viscosity $\Delta \eta$ after reaching a maximum relaxes to zero as $\gamma ^{-2}t^{-3/2}$. $\Delta \eta$ and other observables exhibit log-time periodic oscillations which can be interpreted as due to a growth mechanism where stretching and break-up of domains cyclically occur.   In the case of an oscillating shear a cross-over phenomenon is observed: Initially the evolution is characterized by the same growth exponents as for a stationary flow. For longer times the phase separating structure cannot align with the oscillating drift and a different regime is entered with an isotropic growth and the same exponents of the case without shear.",F.

The observables are obtained to high jet resolution scales with the JADE, Durham, Cambridge and cone jet finders, and compared with the predictions of various QCD and Monte Carlo models. The strong coupling strength, alpha_s, is determined at each energy by fits of O(alpha_s^2) calculations, as well as matched O(alpha_s^2) and NLLA predictions, to the data. Matching schemes are compared, and the dependence of the results on the choice of the renormalization scale is investigated. The combination of the results using matched predictions gives alpha_s(MZ)=0.1187+{0.0034}-{0.0019}.

The transformation of the variational formula for spherically-symmetric systems leads to two natural variants of the effective action. One of these variants describes the shell from a stationary interior observer's point of view, another from the exterior one. The conditions of isometry of the exterior and interior faces of the shell lead to the momentum and Hamiltonian constraints.

Two main classes of membranes can be distinguished: Fluid membranes and polymerized, tethered membranes.

We start by collecting basic physical properties, clarifying the role of bending rigidity and disorder, theoretically and experimentally as well as numerically. We then give a thorough introduction into the theory of self-avoiding membranes, or more generally non-local field theories with delta-like interactions. Based on a proof of perturbative renormalizability for non-local field-theories, renormalization group calculations can be performed up to 2-loop order, which in 3 dimensions predict a crumpled phase with fractal dimension of about 2.4. The tricritical behavior of membranes is discussed and shown to be quite different from that of polymers. Dynamical properties are studied in the same frame-work. Along the same lines, disorder can be included leading to interesting applications. We also construct a generalization of the O(N)-model, which in the limit N->0 reduces to self-avoiding membranes in analogy with the O(N)-model, which in the limit N->0 reduces to self-avoiding polymers.

We show that our scheme is consistent with chiral symmetry, in particular with the Goldstone theorem and the Gell-Mann Oakes Renner relation. The numerical part focuses on the pion and the rho-meson sector. For the latter the 1/N_c-corrections are crucial in order to include the dominant rho -> pi pi-decay channel, while the leading-order approximation only contains unphysical q\bar q-decay channels.

In the optical, RX J0134.2-4258 appears as an extreme 'Narrow-Line Seyfert 1 galaxy' (NLS1), with very strong FeII emission, very blue optical continuum spectrum and almost no Narrow Line Region emission. While its spectrum was one of the softest observed from an AGN during the ROSAT All-Sky Survey, its spectrum was found to be dramatically harder during a pointed observation although the count rate remained constant. We found in the pointed observation that the spectrum is softer when it is fainter and spectral fitting demonstrates that it is the hard component that is variable. The ASCA observation confirms the presence of a hard X-ray power law, the slope of which is rather flat compared with other NLS1s. Survey and followup radio observations reveal that RX J0134.2-4258 is also unusual in that it is a member of the rare class of radio-loud NLS1s, and, with R=71, it holds the current record for largest radio-to-optical ratio in NLS1s.

Our result generalizes previous statements for the quasiprojective case. An important tool for the proof is a universal reduction of an arbitrary toric variety to a divisorial one.

The solution relies on identification of operator-loops which change the configuration sign when updated (``merons'') and is similar to the meron-cluster algorithm recently proposed by Chandrasekharan and Wiese for solving the sign problem for a class of fermion models (Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 83}, 3116 (1999)). Some important expectation values, e.g., the internal energy, can be evaluated in the subspace with no merons, where the weight function is positive definite. Calculations of other expectation values require sampling of configurations with only a small number of merons (typically zero or two), with an accompanying sign problem which is not serious.

Under the conditions that: 1) the isoelectronium is stable; 2) the effective size of the isoelectronium is ignorable, in comparison to internuclear distance; and 3) the two nuclei are at rest, the Santilli-Shillady model of the $H_2$ molecule is reduced to a restricted {\it three-body} system essentially similar to a neutral version of the $H_2^+$ ion, which, as such, admits exact solution.

astro-ph/0001415v1,Measuring the Diffuse Optical Light in Abell 1651,"Using drift scan data, a new approach to determining surface brightness profiles, and techniques for detecting low surface brightness signals, we fit the light profile of the brightest cluster galaxy (BCG) in the rich cluster Abell 1651 out to 670 h^{-1} kpc. This radius is a significant fraction of the virial radius of the cluster (2 h^{-1} Mpc; Girardi et al. 1998), indicating that the sizes of the BCG and the cluster are comparable. We find that the profile is consistent with a de Vaucouleurs profile over the radial range probed. We also find that the integrated light profile of the BCG in Abell 1651 contributes 36% of the total cluster light within 500 h^{-1} kpc. Including all luminous components, we obtain M/L_I~160 h for the cluster, which would be overestimated by ~20% without the BCG halo. Furthermore, the relatively red color of the BCG at large radii suggests that recent disruption and tidal stripping of spirals and dwarf ellipticals do not contribute significantly to the halo luminosity. The color and the form of the profile are consistent with a scenario in which the BCG forms from filamentary collapse during the epoch of cluster formation, with relatively little evolution in the past 5 Gyrs (Dubinski 1998). We remove the BCG and other detected galaxies from the image and construct a two dimensional surface brightness map of the cluster core.

The analysis is motivated by experiments conducted under the low level and random effective acceleration field that is typical of a microgravity environment. When the boundary is planar and is being vibrated along its own plane, the variance of the velocity field decays as a power law of distance away from the boundary. If a low frequency cut-off is introduced in the power spectrum of the boundary velocity, the variance decays exponentially for distances larger than a Stokes layer thickness based on the cut-off frequency. Vibration of a gently curved boundary results in steady streaming in the ensemble average of the tangential velocity. Its amplitude diverges logarithmically with distance away from the boundary, but asymptotes to a constant value instead if a low frequency cut-off is considered. This steady component of the velocity is shown to depend logarithmically on the cut-off frequency. Finally, we consider the case of a periodically modulated solid boundary that is being randomly vibrated. We find steady streaming in the ensemble average of the first order velocity, with flow extending up to a characteristic distance of the order of the boundary wavelength. The structure of the flow in the vicinity of the boundary depends strongly on the correlation time of the boundary velocity.",Dmitri Volfson; Jorge Vinals,nlin.PS,nlin.PS; physics.flu-dyn

Spectra obtained at different dates when the source was in low states at a comparable V magnitude, show the presence of strong Zeeman absorption features and marked changes in emission lines with a day-to-day reappearance of the HeII (4686\AA) emission lines in 1991. Despite this variability, the magnetic field inferred from the fitting of the absorption spectrum with Zeeman hydrogen splitting, is remarkably constant with a best value of (12.5$\pm$0.5)MG. Detailed analysis of the UBVRI light curves shows the presence of repetitive moderate amplitude ($\sim$ 0.3-0.5 mag) flares predominantly red in colour. These flares are attributed to small accretion events and are compared to the large ($\sim$ 2 mag.) blue flare reported by Shakhovskoy et al. (1993). We suggest that the general flaring activity observed during the low states is generated by accretion events.

Both the Coloumb and exchange integrals have been calculated only for $V_e$ owing to Gegenbauer expansion while for $V_g$ and $V_h$ cases we achieved analytical results only for the Coloumb integrals. We conclude that the $V_e$-based model is capable to fit experimental data on $H_2$ molecule in confirmation of the results of numerical HFR approach by Santilli and Shillady. Also, we achieved the energy-based estimation of the weight of the isoelectronium phase which is appeared to be of the order of 1%...6%, for the case of $V_e$. However, we note that this is {\it not} the result corresponding to the original Santilli-Shillady model, which is based on the Hulten potential $V_h$. An interesting result is that in order to prevent divergency of the Coloumb integral for $V_h$ the correlation length parameter $r_c$ should run discrete set of values.

cond-mat/0001353v1,"""Thermometers"" of Speculative Frenzy","Establishing unambiguously the existence of speculative bubbles is an on-going controversy complicated by the need of defining a model of fundamental prices. Here, we present a novel empirical method which bypasses all the difficulties of the previous approaches by monitoring external indicators of an anomalously growing interest in the public at times of bubbles. From the definition of a bubble as a self-fulfilling reinforcing price change, we identify indicators of a possible self-reinforcing imitation between agents in the market. We show that during the build-up phase of a bubble, there is a growing interest in the public for the commodity in question, whether it consists in stocks, diamonds or coins. That interest can be estimated through different indicators: increase in the number of books published on the topic, increase in the subscriptions to specialized journals. Moreover, the well-known empirical rule according to which the volume of sales is growing during a bull market finds a natural interpretation in this framework: sales increases in fact reveal and pinpoint the progress of the bubble's diffusion throughout society. We also present a simple model of rational expectation which maps exactly onto the Ising model on a random graph. The indicators are then interpreted as ``thermometers'', measuring the balance between idiosyncratic information (noise temperature) and imitation (coupling) strength. In this context, bubbles are interpreted as low or critical temperature phases, where the imitation strength carries market prices up essentially independently of fundamentals. Contrary to the naive conception of a bubble and a crash as times of disorder, on the contrary, we show that bubbles and crashes are times where the concensus is too strong.",B. M. Roehner; D.

  Hole Binary Systems","We present approximate analytical solutions to the Hamiltonian and momentum constraint equations, corresponding to systems composed of two black holes with arbitrary linear and angular momentum. The analytical nature of these initial data solutions makes them easier to implement in numerical evolutions than the traditional numerical approach of solving the elliptic equations derived from the Einstein constraints. Although in general the problem of setting up initial conditions for black hole binary simulations is complicated by the presence of singularities, we show that the methods presented in this work provide initial data with $l_1$ and $l_\infty$ norms of violation of the constraint equations falling below those of the truncation error (residual error due to discretization) present in finite difference codes for the range of grid resolutions currently used. Thus, these data sets are suitable for use in evolution codes. Detailed results are presented for the case of a head-on collision of two equal-mass M black holes with specific angular momentum 0.5M at an initial separation of 10M. A straightforward superposition method yields data adequate for resolutions of $h=M/4$, and an ""attenuated"" superposition yields data usable to resolutions at least as fine as $h=M/8$. In addition, the attenuated approximate data may be more tractable in a full (computational) exact solution to the initial value problem.",P. Marronetti; M. Huq; P. Laguna; L. Lehner; R. Matzner; D.

astro-ph/0001420v1,Screw Instability and Blandford-Znajek Mechanism,"When magnetic field lines thread a rotating black hole's horizon and connect with remote astrophysical loads, the rotational energy of the black hole can be extracted through the Blandford-Znajek mechanism. Due to the rotation of the black hole, the magnetic field lines are twisted and toroidal components are generated. So poloidal electric currents are induced and the black hole's rotational energy is transported to the astrophysical loads through Poynting flux. The Blandford-Znajek mechanism has been considered to be a possible process for powering extragalactic jets.   In this paper we show that due to the screw instability of magnetic field, the toroidal components of the magnetic field, and thus the poloidal currents, cannot exceed the limits given by the Kruskal-Shafranov criterion. This significantly lowers the power of the Blandford-Znajek mechanism when the loads are far from the black hole. So the Blandford-Znajek mechanism can only work efficiently within the neighborhood of the black hole.

Here \theta_E and \tilde r_E are the angular and projected Einstein radii, M is the mass of the lens, and \pi_rel is the lens-source relative parallax.

gr-qc/0001078v1,Stability of self-gravitating magnetic monopoles,"The stability of a spherically symmetric self-gravitating magnetic monopole is examined in the thin wall approximation: modeling the interior false vacuum as a region of de Sitter space; the exterior as an asymptotically flat region of the Reissner-Nordstr\""om geometry; and the boundary separating the two as a charged domain wall. There remains only to determine how the wall gets embedded in these two geometries. In this approximation, the ratio $k$ of the false vacuum to surface energy densities is a measure of the symmetry breaking scale $\eta$. Solutions are characterized by this ratio, the charge on the wall $Q$, and the value of the conserved total energy $M$. We find that for each fixed $k$ and $Q$ up to some critical value, there exists a unique globally static solution, with $M\simeq Q^{3/2}$; any stable radial excitation has $M$ bounded above by $Q$, the value assumed in an extremal Reissner-Nordstr\""om geometry and these are the only solutions with $M<Q$. As $M$ is raised above $Q$ a black hole forms in the exterior: (i) for low $Q$ or $k$, the wall is crushed; (ii) for higher values, it oscillates inside the black hole. If the mass is not too high these `collapsing' solutions co-exist with an inflating bounce; (iii) for $k$, $Q$ or $M$ outside the above regimes, there is a unique inflating solution. In case (i) the course of the bounce lies within a single asymptotically flat region (AFR) and it resembles closely the bounce exhibited by a false vacuum bubble (with Q=0). In cases (ii) and (iii) the course of the bounce spans two consecutive AFRs.",Guillermo Arreaga; Inyong Cho; Jemal Guven,gr-qc,gr-qc

We study the interaction between the intracluster medium and an extended gas component of dwarf galaxies confined by a surrounding cold dark matter halo analytically and numerically, using axisymmetric two-dimensional hydrodynamical simulations at high resolution. The results show that the gas within the dark matter halo is totally stripped in a typical galactic cluster. The process of ram pressure stripping therefore must have played an important role during the chemo-dynamical evolution of dwarf galaxies in galactic clusters.

physics/0001058v1,Calculation of positron binding to silver and gold atoms,"Positron binding to silver and gold atoms was studied using a fully {\it ab initio} relativistic method, which combines the configuration interaction method with many-body perturbation theory. It was found that the silver atom forms a bound state with a positron with binding energy 123 ($\pm$ 20%) meV, while the gold atom cannot bind a positron. Our calculations reveal the importance of the relativistic effects for positron binding to heavy atoms. The role of these effects was studied by varying the value of the fine structure constant $\alpha$. In the non-relativistic limit, $\alpha = 0$, both systems $e^+$Ag and $e^+$Au are bound with binding energies of about 200 meV for $e^+$Ag and 220 meV for $e^+$Au. Relativistic corrections for a negative ion are essentially different from that for a positron interacting with an atom. Therefore, the calculation of electron affinities cannot serve as a test of the method used for positron binding in the non-relativistic case. However, it is still a good test of the relativistic calculations. Our calculated electron affinities for silver (1.327 eV) and gold (2.307 eV) atoms are in very good agreement with corresponding experimental values (1.303 eV and 2.309 eV respectively).",V. A.

At delta t < lp, this uncertainty relation takes roughly the form delta t delta x > lp^2, which can be derived from the condition prohibiting the multi-production of probes to a geometry. We show that there exists a minimal area rather than a minimal length in the four-dimensional case. We study also a three-dimensional free field theory on a non-commutative space-time realizing the uncertainty relation.

In a thermodynamic interpretation, this implies that there is no pressure of order N and that the chiral condensate of order N is temperature independent.

astro-ph/0001424v1,Stellar Dynamics and the implications on the merger evolution in NGC6240,"We report near-infrared integral field spectroscopy of the luminous merging galaxy NGC 6240. Stellar velocities show that the two K-band peaks separated by 1.6arcsec are the central parts of inclined, rotating disk galaxies with equal mass bulges. The dynamical masses of the nuclei are much larger than the stellar mass derived from the K-band light, implying that the progenitor galaxies were galaxies with massive bulges. The K-band light is dominated by red supergiants formed in the two nuclei in starbursts, triggered ~2x10^7 years ago, possibly by the most recent perigalactic approach. Strong feedback effects of a superwind and supernovae are responsible for a short duration burst (~5x10^6 years) which is already decaying. The two galaxies form a prograde-retrograde rotating system and from the stellar velocity field it seems that one of the two interacting galaxies is subject to a prograde encounter. Between the stellar nuclei is a prominent peak of molecular gas (H_2, CO). The stellar velocity dispersion peaks there indicating that the gas has formed a local, self-gravitating concentration decoupled from the stellar gravitational potential. NGC 6240 has previously been reported to fit the paradigm of an elliptical galaxy formed through the merger of two galaxies. This was based on the near-infrared light distribution which follows a r^1/4-law. Our data cast strong doubt on this conclusion: the system is by far not relaxed, rotation plays an important role, as does self-gravitating gas, and the near-infrared light is dominated by young stars.",M.

A variant for ``first-generation'' experiments can be obtained, if $B_s\to K^+K^-$ is replaced by $B_d\to\pi^\mp K^\pm$. We show that the most recent experimental results for the CP-averaged $B_d\to\pi^+\pi^-$ and $B_d\to\pi^\mp K^\pm$ branching ratios imply a rather restricted range for the corresponding penguin parameters, and upper bounds on the direct CP asymmetries $A_{CP}^{dir}(B_d\to\pi^+\pi^-)$ and $A_{CP}^{dir}(B_d\to\pi^\mp K^\pm)$. Moreover, we point out that interesting constraints on $\gamma$ can be obtained from the CP-averaged $B_d\to\pi^+\pi^-$ and $B_d\to\pi^\mp K^\pm$ branching ratios, if in addition mixing-induced CP violation in the former decay is measured, and the $B^0_d$--$\bar{B^0_d}$ mixing phase is fixed through $B_d\to J/\psi K_S$.

We found a new hard production mechanism which is related to the possibility for a real photon to fluctuate into a massless $q\bar q$ pair in a chiral-odd spin configuration. Each helicity amplitude is given as a sum of a usual chiral-even contribution (when the helicities of quark and antiquark are antiparallel) and this additional chiral-odd part (where the helicities of quark and antiquark are parallel). The chiral-odd contribution is large, it leads to a dominance of the non spin-flip amplitude in a very broad region of intermediately high $|t|$. All amplitudes are expressed in terms of short distance asymptotics of the light-cone wave functions of vector meson (photon). We demonstrate that for each helicity amplitude there exists a soft non-factorizable contribution.

We discuss the validity of this model, in particular in terms of field reversals and radial extensions. We conclude that with such a model one cannot retreive any directional information from the observed direction of the cosmic rays. In particular one cannot identify point sources at least up to energies of about 200 EeV. Therefore the apparent clustering of the back-traced highest energy cosmic rays observed to date cannot be interpreted as an evidence for a point source nor for the identification of M87, which happens to be close to the North pole, as being such a source.",Pierre Billoir; Antoine Letessier-Selvon,astro-ph,astro-ph

Gravities derived from LTE ionization balance in metal-poor stars with [Fe/H]< -1 are likely too low, and could be responsible for an underestimation of the oxygen abundances derived using the [OI] line.

Thereby we evaluated single-particle spectra (PES & IPES), two-particle spectra (spin & density correlation functions), and the dynamical correlation function of suitably defined diagnostic operators, all as a function of temperature and hole doping. The results allow to identify different physical regimes. Near half-filling we find an anomalous `Hubbard-I phase', where the band structure is, up to some minor modifications, consistent with the Hubbard-I predictions. At lower temperatures, where the spin response becomes sharp, additional dispersionless `bands' emerge due to the dressing of electrons/holes with spin excitatons. We present a simple phenomenological fit which reproduces the band structure of the insulator quantitatively. The Fermi surface volume in the low doping phase, as derived from the single-particle spectral function, is not consistent with the Luttinger theorem, but qualitatively in agreement with the predictions of the Hubbard-I approximation. The anomalous phase extends up to a hole concentration of 15%, i.e. the underdoped region in the phase diagram of high-T_c superconductors. We also investigate the nature of the magnetic ordering transition in the single particle spectra. We show that the transition to an SDW-like band structure is not accomplished by the formation of any resolvable `precursor bands', but rather by a (spectroscopically invisible) band of spin 3/2 quasiparticles.

We discover an X-ray beat-cycle modulation, indicating that an enhanced accretion stream couples directly with the magnetosphere in outburst, confirming our previous prediction. Optical eclipse profiles late in outburst show that the visible light is dominated by an enhanced mass-transfer stream overflowing the accretion disc. We are uncertain whether the enhanced mass transfer is triggered by a disc instability, or by some other cause.

hep-th/0001166v1,A Note on Solitons in Brane Worlds,"We obtain the zero mode effective action for gravitating objects in the bulk of dilatonic domain walls. Without additional fields included in the bulk action, the zero mode effective action reproduces the action in one lower dimensions obtained through the ordinary Kaluza-Klein (KK) compactification, only when the transverse (to the domain wall) component of the bulk metric does not have non-trivial term depending on the domain wall worldvolume coordinates. With additional fields included in the bulk action, non-trivial dependence of the transverse metric component on the domain wall worldvolume coordinates appears to be essential in reproducing the lower-dimensional action obtained via the ordinary KK compactification. We find, in particular, that the effective action for the charged (p+1)-brane in the domain wall bulk reproduces the action for the p-brane in one lower dimensions.",Donam Youm,hep-th,hep-th; gr-qc

Specifically, we present numerical simulations and a mean field analysis of pyrochlore Ising systems in the presence of nearest neighbor exchange and long range dipolar interactions. We find that two possible phases can occur, a long range ordered antiferromagnetic one and the other dominated by spin ice features. Our quantitative theory is in very good agreement with experimental data on both ${\rm Ho_{2}Ti_{2}O_{7}}$ and ${\rm Dy_{2}Ti_{2}O_{7}}$.

In addition, we show that under charge conjugation the theory on noncommutative $R^4_{\theta}$ is transformed to the theory on $R^4_{-\theta}$, so NCQED is a CP violating theory.

astro-ph/0001429v2,Comptonization of the Cosmic Microwave Background by Relativistic Plasma,"(Abridged) We investigate the spectral distortion of the cosmic microwave background (CMB) caused by relativistic plasma. Within the Thomson regime, an exact analytic expression for the photon scattering kernel of a momentum power-law electron distribution is given. The ultra-relativistic Sunyaev-Zeldovich (SZ) decrement measures the electron number and not the energy content. On the other hand, the relativistic SZ increment at higher frequencies depends strongly on the spectral shape of the electrons. We calculate the expected Comptonization due to the energy release of radio galaxies, which we estimate to be 3 10^66 erg Gpc^-3. We investigate Comptonization from (a) the part of the released energy which is thermalized and (b) the relativistic, remnant radio plasma, which may form a second, relativistic phase in the inter galactic medium, nearly unobservable for present day instruments (presence of so called 'radio ghosts'). We find a thermal Comptonization parameter due to (a) of y = 10^-6 and (b) an optical depth of relativistic electrons in old radio plasma of tau_rel < 10^-7. If a substantial fraction of the volume of clusters of galaxies is filled with such old radio plasma the SZ effect based determination of the Hubble constant is biased to lower values. Finally, it is shown that a supra-thermal population of electrons in the Coma cluster would produce a signature in the Wien-tail of the CMB, which is marginally detectable with a multifrequency measurement by the Planck satellite. Such a population is expected to exist, since its bremsstrahlung would explain Coma's recently reported high energy X-ray excess.",Torsten A. Ensslin; Christian R. Kaiser,astro-ph,astro-ph

The emphasis is in the problem of age-dating distant young clusters (<2 Gyr) from their integrated colours. It is shown that U-B and B-V are less sensitive to metallicity than colours involving red pass-bands, like V-I, at least up to ages of some few Gyr. Since U-B and B-V are determined by well-understood and well-populated evolutionary stages, they are also less affected by theoretical uncertainties and by the ubiquitous effect of stochastic colour dispersion. The latter effects become important for the V-K colour. Thus, we argue that U-B and B-V are, presently, the more suitable broad-band colours for age-dating distant clusters. For other potentially useful colours like V-R and V-I, empirical tests of their evolution are still missing.",Leo Girardi,astro-ph,astro-ph

astro-ph/0001435v1,"The MACHO Project 9 Million Star Color-Magnitude Diagram of the Large
  Magellanic Cloud","We present a 9 million star color-magnitude diagram (9M CMD) of the LMC bar. The 9M CMD reveals a complex superposition of different age and metallicity stellar populations, with important stellar evolutionary phases occurring over 3 orders of magnitude in number density. First, we count the non-variable supergiants, the associated Cepheids, and measure the effective temperatures defining the instability strip. Lifetime predictions of stellar evolution theory are tested, with implications for the origin of low-luminosity Cepheids. The highly-evolved AGB stars have a bimodal distribution in brightness, which we interpret as discrete old populations (>1 Gyr). The faint AGB may be metal-poor and very old. We identify the clusters NGC 411 and M3 as templates for the admixture of old stellar populations. However, there are indications that the old and metal-poor field population has a red HB morphology: the RR Lyraes lie on the red edge of the instability strip, the AGB-bump is very red, and the ratio of AGB-bump stars to RR Lyraes is quite large. If the HB second parameter is age, the old and metal-poor field population likely formed after the oldest clusters. Lifetime predictions of stellar evolution theory lead us to associate a significant fraction of the red HB clump giants with the same old and metal-poor population producing the RR Lyraes and the AGB-bump. In this case, compared to the age-dependent luminosity predictions of stellar evolution theory, the red HB clump is too bright relative to the RR Lyraes and AGB-bump. Last, the surface density profile of RR Lyraes is fit by an exponential, favoring a disk-like rather than spheroidal distribution. We conclude that the age of the LMC disk is probably similar to the age of the Galactic disk. (ABRIDGED)",C. Alcock; R. A. Allsman; D. R. Alves; T. S. Axelrod; A. Basu; A. C. Becker; D. P.

System preparation in a closed tubing system results in precisely controlled number densities between 1E16/m3 and 1E19/m^3 (packing fractions between 1E-7 and 1E-2) and electrolyte concentrations between 1E-7 and 1E-3 mol/l. Due to long ranged Coulomb repulsion some of the systems show a pronounced fluid or crystalline order. Under deionized conditions we find s to depend linearily on the packing fraction with no detectable influence of the phase transitions. Further at constant packing fraction s increases sublinearily with increasing number of dissociable surface groups N. As a function of c the conductivity shows pronounced differences depending on the kind of electrolyte used. We propose a simple yet powerful model based on independent migration of all species present and additivity of the respective conductivity contributions. It takes account of small ion macro-ion interactions in terms of an effectivly transported charge. The model successfully describes our qualitatively complex experimental observations.

In this contribution I will review X-ray observations and their implication on our undertstanding on the GRB phenomenon. These measurements are providing a direct probe into the nature of the progenitor and a measurement of the GRB beaming properties, crucial to establish the total energy output. Some evidence of iron lines connects the GRB explosion with massive progenitors, thence with star-forming regions.

On March 11, a strong type-I X-ray burst was detected with evidence of photospheric radius expansion. A follow-up target of opportunity observation with the Narrow-Field Instruments (NFI) was performed on March 11 and 12, for a total elapsed time of 8.51 x 10^{4} s. The wide band spectral data (0.1-200 keV) obtained with the NFI show a remarkable hard X-ray spectrum detected up to ~200 keV, which can be described by a power law with photon spectral index Gamma=1.96\pm0.04, plus a soft component which is compatible with blackbody radiation of temperature kT~0.5 keV.   The detection of the type-I X-ray burst is a strong indication that the compact object is a neutron star in a low mass X-ray binary system. Assuming standard burst parameters and attributing the photospheric radius expansion to near Eddington luminosity, we estimate a distance of ~5 kpc.

We calculate the transition radius out to which the disc specific angular momentum vector is aligned with that of the black hole. We focus on the parameter regime where the warp dynamics are controlled by bending wave propagation, but also consider models in which warps are subject to diffusion rather than wave transport, and are able to consider the fully nonlinear regime. Because of hydrodynamic or pressure effects, for the parameter range investigated, the transition radius is always found to be much smaller than that obtained by Bardeen & Petterson (1975). For discs with midplane Mach numbers of about 10, the transition occurs between 10 - 16 gravitational radii, whereas for a Mach number of about 30 it occurs at around 30 gravitational radii. A thicker disc with a Mach number of 5 is found to produce no discernible warped structure. The rate of black hole - disc alignment is found to be consistent with the ideas of Ress (1978), with the alignment torque behaving as if it arises from the accreted material transferring its misaligned component of angular momentum at the larger transition radius of Bardeen & Petterson (1975). The inclusion of Einstein precession in the calculations modified both the warped disc structure and, consistent with linear analysis, produced an increased alignment rate by up to a factor of 4 because of the effect that a non Keplerian potential has on the propagation of warps.",Richard P.

The lattice defects are introduced by irradiating the film with high-energy (\simeq 6 MeV) electrons with a maximal fluence of about 2\times 10^{17} cm^{-2}. This comparatively low dose of irradiation produces rather small radiation damage in the films. The number of displacements per atom (dpa) in the irradiated sample is about 10^{-5}. Nethertheless, this results in an appreciable increase in the film resistivity. The percentage of resistivity increase in the ferromagnetic metallic state (below the Curie tempetature T_{c}) was much greater than that observed in the insulating state (above T_{c}).

This technique also allows simple incorporation of new data and reduction of errors with the introduction of more precise data. Application of our method indicates that previous error estimates on the calculated abundances were too large by as much as a factor of three. Since uncertainties in the BBN calculation currently dominate inferences drawn from light-element abundances, the re-estimated errors have important consequences for cosmic baryon density, neutrino physics, and lithium depletion in halo stars.

These models solve the ""kinematic"" puzzles of cosmology as well as inflation does, but cannot by themselves solve the flatness problem, since in their purest form no violation of the strong energy condition occurs. We also consider a heterotic model (VSL plus inflation) which provides a number of observational implications for the low-redshift universe if chi contributes to the ""dark energy"" either as CDM or quintessence. These implications include modified gravitational lensing, birefringence, variation of fundamental constants and rotation of the plane of polarization of light from distant sources.",Bruce A.

astro-ph/0001428v1,Stellar Dynamics in the Galactic centre: Proper Motions and Anisotropy,"We report a new analysis of stellar dynamics in the Galactic centre, based on improved sky and LOS velocities for >100 stars within a few arcsec of SgrA*. Overall the motions do not deviate strongly from isotropy. For 32 stars with all 3 components determined the absolute, LOS and sky velocities agree well, as for a spherical cluster. The projected radial and tangential motions of all 104 pm stars are also consistent with overall isotropy. However, the projected velocities of the young, early type stars have a strong radial dependence. Most of the bright HeI stars 1-10"" from SgrA* are on tangential orbits. This anisotropy of the HeI stars and most of the brighter IRS16 complex members is largely caused by a CW and counter-rotating, coherent rotation pattern. The overall rotation of the young star cluster probably is a remnant of the angular momentum in the cloud these stars formed from. The fainter, fast stars within \~1"" of SgrA* appear to be largely moving on radial or very elliptical orbits. We have not detected nonlinear motion for any of them. Most of the SgrA* cluster members also are on CW orbits. Spectroscopy shows them to be early type stars. We propose that the SgrA* cluster stars are those members of the early type cluster with small angular momentum which can plunge to the vicinity of SgrA*. Our anisotropy-independent estimate of the Sun-GC distance is 7.8-8.2 kpc (+/- 0.9 kpc). We include velocity anisotropy in estimating the central mass distribution. We confirm previous conclusions that a compact central mass concentration is present and dominates the potential from 0.01-1 pc. The central mass ranges from 2.6-3.3E6 M_sun. (abridged)",R.

This singles out the cases p=1,2,3,5,9. For p=3,5,9 the superembedding geometry naturally involves a fundamental super 2-form potential on the worldvolume whose generalised field strength obeys a constraint deducible from considering an open supermembrane ending on the p-brane. This constraint, together with the embedding constraint, puts the system on-shell for p=5 but overconstrains the 9-brane in D=11 such that the Goldstone superfield is frozen. For p=3 these two constraints give rise to an off-shell linear multiplet on the worldvolume. An alternative formulation of this case is given in which the linear multiplet is dualised to an off-shell scalar multiplet. Actions are constructed for both cases and are shown to give equivalent equations of motion. After gauge fixing a local Sp(1) symmetry associated with shifts in the Sp(1)_R Goldstone modes, we find that the auxiliary fields in the scalar multiplet parametrise a two-sphere. For completeness we also discuss briefly the cases p=1,2 where the equations of motion (for off-shell multiplets) are obtained from an action principle.",P. S. Howe; A. Kaya; E. Sezgin; P.

  liquid","Andreev scattering and the Josephson current through a one-dimensional interacting electron liquid sandwiched between two superconductors are re-examined. We first present some apparently new results on the non-interacting case by studying an exactly solvable tight-binding model rather than the usual continuum model. We show that perfect Andreev scattering (i.e. zero normal scattering) at the Fermi energy can only be achieved by fine-tuning junction parameters. We also obtain exact results for the Josephson current, which is generally a smooth function of the superconducting phase difference except when the junction parameters are adjusted to give perfect Andreev scattering, in which case it becomes a sawtooth function. We then observe that, even when interactions are included, all low energy properties of a junction (E<<\Delta, the superconducting gap) can be obtained by ""integrating out"" the superconducting electrons to obtain an effective Hamiltonian describing the metallic electrons only with a boundary pairing interaction. This boundary model provides a suitable starting point for bosonization/renormalization group/boundary conformal field theory analysis. We argue that total normal reflection and total Andreev reflection correspond to two fixed points of the boundary renormalization group. For repulsive bulk interactions the Andreev fixed point is unstable and the normal one stable. However, the reverse is true for attractive interactions. This implies that a generic junction Hamiltonian (without fine-tuned junction parameters) will renormalize to the normal fixed point for repulsive interactions but to the Andreev one for attractive interactions.

Comparison with data from the SARS red-shift catalogue, and the LEDA database provides a good fit with a correlation length $\xi \sim 300$ Mpc. The geometrical interpretation is clear: At small distances, the universe is zero-dimensional and point-like. At distances of the order of 1 Mpc the dimension is unity, indicating a filamentary, string-like structure; when viewed at larger scales it gradually becomes 2-dimensional wall-like, and finally, at and beyond the correlation length, it becomes uniform.",Per Bak; Kan Chen,astro-ph,astro-ph; cond-mat.stat-mech; nlin.AO

It is shown that the dynamically screened electron-electron interaction in a nanoparticle contains a size-dependent correction induced by the surface. This leads to new channels of quasiparticle scattering accompanied by the emission of surface collective excitations. In noble-metal particles, the dipole collective excitations (surface plasmons) mediate a resonant scattering of d-holes to the conduction band. The role of this effect in the ultrafast optical dynamics of small nanoparticles is studied. With decreasing nanoparticle size, it leads to a strong change in the differential absorption lineshape and a strong frequency dependence of the relaxation near the surface plasmon resonance.

astro-ph/0001446v1,Preheated Advection Dominated Accretion Flow,"All high temperature accretion solutions including ADAF are physically thick, so outgoing radiation interacts with the incoming flow, sharing as much or more resemblance with classical spherical accretion flows as with disk flows. We examine this interaction for the popular ADAF case. We find that without allowance for Compton preheating, a very restricted domain of ADAF solution is permitted and with Compton preheating included a new high temperature PADAF branch appears in the solution space. In the absence of preheating, high temperature flows do not exist when the mass accretion rate mdot == Mdot c^2 / L_E >~ 10^-1.5. Below this mass accretion rate, a roughly conical region around the hole cannot sustain high temperature ions and electrons for all flows having mdot >~ 10^-4, which may lead to a funnel possibly filled with a tenuous hot outgoing wind. If the flow starts at large radii with the usual equilibrium temperature ~10^4 K, the critical mass accretion rate is much lower, mdot \~10^-3.7 above which level no self-consistent ADAF (without preheating) can exist. However, above this critical mass accretion rate, the flow can be self-consistently maintained at high temperature if Compton preheating is considered. These solutions constitute a new branch of solutions as in spherical accretion flows. High temperature PADAF flows can exist above the critical mass accretion rate in addition to the usual cold thin disk solutions. We also find solutions where the flow near the equatorial plane accretes normally while the flow near the pole is overheated by Compton preheating, possibly becoming, a polar wind, solutions which we designate WADAF.",Myeong-Gu Park; Jeremiah P.

When a moderate m_{ll} cut is applied, A_T^{peak} depends on the \tilde{\chi}^0_2 velocity distribution, but the dependence would be corrected by studying the lepton P_T distribution. A_T^{peak} and the edge of m_{ll} distributions are used to determine the mass parameters involved in the decay for parameters of interest to LHC experiments. For some cases the ino and slepton masses may be determined within 10% by the lepton distribution only independent of model assumptions.

math/0001144v1,"Symbolic computation of the roots of any polynomial with integer
  coefficients","The roots of any polynomial of degree m with integer coefficients, can be computed by manipulation of sequences made from 2m distinct symbols and counting the different symbols in the sequences. This method requires only 'primitive' operations like replacement of sequences and counting of symbols. No calculations using 'advanced' operations like multiplication, division, logarithms etc. are needed. The method can be implemented as a geometric construction of roots of polynomials to arbitrary accuracy using only a straight edge, a compass, and pencils of 2m different colors. In particular, the ancient problem of the ""doubling of cube"" is soluble asymptotically by the above-mentioned construction. This method, by which a cube can be doubled, albeit, in infinite steps, is probably the closest to the original problem of construction using only a straight edge and compass in a finite number of steps.   Moreover, to every polynomial of degree m over the field of rationals, can be associated an m-term recurrence relation for generating integer sequences. A set of m such sequences, which together exhibit interesting properties related to the roots of the polynomial, can be obtained if the m initial terms of each of these m sequences is chosen in a special way using a matrix associated with the polynomial. Only two of these integer sequences need to be computed to obtain the real root having the largest absolute value.

We find spectral sequences $$E^2_{p,q}=H_p(\Lambda V\otimes\Gamma^q(dV))\Rightarrow HH_{p+q}(\Lambda V)$$ and $${E'}^2_{\pq}=H_p(\Lambda V\otimes\Gamma^{\le q}(dV)) \Rightarrow HC_{p+q}(\Lambda V)$$ The algebra $\Lambda V\otimes\Gamma(dV)$ is a divided power version of the de Rham algebra; in the particular case when $k$ is a field of characteristic zero, the spectral sequences above agree with those found by Burghelea and Vigu\'e (Cyclic homology of commutative algebras I, Lecture Notes in Math. {\bf 1318} (1988) 51-72), where it is shown they degenerate at the $E^2$ term. For arbitrary ground rings we prove here (Theorem 2.3) that if $V_n=0$ for $n\ge 2$ then $E^2=E^\infty$. From this we derive a formula for the Hochschild homology of flat complete intersections in terms of a filtration of the complex for crystalline cohomology, and find a description of ${E'}^2$ also in terms of crystalline cohomology (theorem 3.0).

Thus the unitarity is restored and the singularity in the j plane is reduced to a simple pole at j=1.The nuclear structure function at small x behaves as $Q^2\ln(1/x)$.

At low temperatures a marked increase in the effective penetration depth and surface resistance is observed associated with the paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic alignment of the Gd spins. The effective penetration depth has a sharp change in slope at the N\'eel temperature, $T_N$, and the surface resistance peaks at a frequency dependent temperature below 3K. The observed temperature and frequency dependence can be described by a model which assumes a negligibly small interaction between the Gd spins and the electrons in the superconducting state, with a frequency dependent magnetic susceptibility and a Gd spin relaxation time $\tau_s $ being a strong function of temperature.

The characterization of the initial state, which is assumed to be restricted to one side of the barrier, and the time evolution of the density matrix lead to a three-fold path integral which is evaluated in the semiclassical limit. The semiclassical trajectories are found to move in the complex coordinate plane and barrier penetration only arises due to fluctuations. Both the form of the semiclassical paths and the relevant fluctuations change significantly as a function of temperature. The semiclassical analysis leads to a detailed picture of barrier penetration in the real time domain and the changeover from thermal activation to quantum tunneling. Deep tunneling is associated with quasi-zero modes in the fluctuation spectrum about the semiclassical orbits in the long time limit. The connection between this real time description of tunneling and the standard imaginary time instanton approach is established.

This approach yields a sufficient condition for the collection of clopen subsets of a subset of $P^*$ (with respect to induced closures) to be isomorphic to $P$. Applying this result to certain classes of posets we prove some representation theorems and get a topological characterization of orthocomplementations.,R. Breslav; A. Stavrova; R. R.

  reflected emission in the soft state","Using the RXTE/PCA data we study the fast variability of the reflected emission in the soft spectral state of Cyg X-1 by means of Fourier frequency resolved spectroscopy. We find that the rms amplitude of variations of the reflected emission has the same frequency dependence as the primary radiation down to time scales of <30-50 msec. This might indicate that the reflected flux reproduces, with nearly flat response, variations of the primary emission. Such behavior differs notably from the hard spectral state, in which variations of the reflected flux are significantly suppressed in comparison with the primary emission, on time scales shorter than ~0.5-1 sec. If related to the finite light crossing time of the reflector, these results suggest that the characteristic size of the reflector -- presumably an optically thick accretion disk, in the hard spectral state is larger by a factor of >5-10 than in the soft spectral state. Modeling the transfer function of the disk, we estimate the inner radius of the accretion disk R_in~100R_g in the hard and R_in<10R_g in the soft state for a 10M_sun black hole.",M. Gilfanov; E.

astro-ph/0001451v1,Superwind-Driven Intense H_2 Emission in NGC 6240,"We have performed a long-slit K band spectroscopic observation of the luminous infrared galaxy NGC 6240. The peak position of the H_2 v=1-0 S(1) emission in the slit is located ~0.3"" - 0.4"" north of the southern nucleus. It is almost the midpoint between the southern nucleus and the peak position of the ^12CO J=1-0 emission. Based on the line-ratio analyses, we suggest the excitation mechanism of H_2 is pure thermal at most positions. In the southern region we find the following three velocity components in the H_2 emission: the blueshifted shell component (~-250 km s^-1 with respect to V_sys) which is recognized as a distinct C-shape distortion in the velocity field around the southern nucleus, the high-velocity blueshifted ``wing'' component (~-1000 km s^-1 with respect to V_sys), and the component indicating possible line splitting of ~500 km s^-1. The latter two components are extended to the south from the southern nucleus. We show that the kinematic properties of these three components can be reproduced by expanding motion of a shell-like structure around the southern nucleus. The offset peak position of the H_2 emission can be understood if we assume that the shell expanding to the north interacts with the extragalactic molecular gas. At the interface between the shell and the molecular gas concentration the cloud-crushing mechanism proposed by Cowie et al. (1981) may work efficiently, and the intense H_2 emission is thus expected there.

During the first stage of the deformation one has a two-center evolution until the neck radius becomes equal to the radius of the emitted particle. Then the three center starts developing by decreasing with the same amount the two tip distances. In such a way a second minimum, typical for a cluster molecule, appears in the deformation energy.

Particles of species A may perform hopping processes only when particles of different type B are present in their environment. Species B is subject to diffusion-limited reactions. If the density of B particles attains a finite asymptotic value (active state), the A species displays normal diffusion. On the other hand, if the B density decays algebraically ~t^{-a} at long times (inactive state), the effective attractive A-B interaction is weakened. The combination of B decay and activated A hopping processes gives rise to anomalous diffusion, with mean-square displacement < x_A(t)^2 > ~ t^{1-a} for a < 1. Such algebraic subdiffusive behavior ensues for n-th order B annihilation reactions (n B -> 0) with n >=3, and n = 2 for d < 2. The mean-square displacement of the A particles grows only logarithmically with time in the case of B pair annihilation (n = 2) and d >= 2 dimensions. For radioactive B decay (n = 1), the A particles remain localized.

  3.5 Years","We present light curves of a sample of ""transient"" sources observed with the All-Sky Monitor (ASM) of the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer (RXTE). The light curves extend over 3.5 years. They are presented in three groups: six neutron-star systems, eight black-hole-candidate systems, and an additional diverse set of six objects that are either transient sources (in the sense of usually being undetectable) or persistent sources showing transient behavior. The outburst profiles of these sources show reproducible characteristics within one source and from source to source, as well as large variations. These profiles together with the profiles of the hardness ratios from the ASM are a valuable resource for the understanding of accretion instabilities.

astro-ph/0001461v1,The Mid-Infrared Spectra of Normal Galaxies,"The mid-infrared spectra (2.5 to 5 and 5.7 to 11.6 mu) obtained by ISO-PHOT reveal the interstellar medium emission from galaxies powered by star formation to be strongly dominated by the aromatic features at 6.2, 7.7, 8.6 and 11.3 mu. Additional emission appears in-between the features, and an underlying continuum is clearly evident at 3-5 mu. This continuum would contribute about a third of the luminosity in the 3 to 13 mu range. The features together carry 5 to 30% of the 40-to-120 mu `FIR' luminosity. The relative fluxes in individual features depend very weakly on galaxy parameters such as the far-infrared colors, direct evidence that the emitting particles are not in thermal equilibrium. The dip at 10 mu is unlikely to result from silicate absorption, since its shape is invariant among galaxies. The continuum component has a f_nu \~ nu^{0.65} shape between 3 and 5 mu and carries 1 to 4% of the FIR luminosity; its extrapolation to longer wavelengths falls well below the spectrum in the 6 to 12 mu range. This continuum component is almost certainly of non-stellar origin, and is probably due to fluctuating grains without aromatic features. The spectra reported here typify the integrated emission from the interstellar medium of the majority of star-forming galaxies, and could thus be used to obtain redshifts of highly extincted galaxies up to z=3 with SIRTF.",G.

Ensembles are defined by extending the `probability via expectation' approach of Whittle to noncommuting quantities. This approach carries no connotations of unlimited repeatability; hence it can be applied to unique systems such as the universe. Precise concepts and traditional results about complementarity, uncertainty and nonlocality follow with a minimum of technicalities. Probabilities are introduced in a generality supporting so-called effects (i.e., fuzzy events).   States are defined as partial mappings that provide reference values for certain quantities. An analysis of sharpness properties yields well-known no-go theorems for hidden variables. By dropping the sharpness requirement, hidden variable theories such as Bohmian mechanics can be accommodated, but so-called ensemble states turn out to be a more natural realization of a realistic state concept.

As these clusters typically contain more mass in gas than in stars, accretion can play an important role in determining the final stellar masses. Numerical simulations of gas accretion in stellar clusters have found that the stars compete for the available reservoir of gas. The accretion rates are highly nonuniform and are determined primarily by each star's position in the cluster. Stars in the centre accrete more gas, resulting in initial mass segregation. This competitive accretion naturally results in a mass spectrum and is potentially the dominant mechanism for producing the initial mass function. Furthermore, accretion on to the core of a cluster forces it to shrink, which may result in formation of massive stars through collisions.",Ian A. Bonnell,astro-ph,astro-ph

cond-mat/0001390v4,Double-exchange is not the cause of ferromagnetism in doped manganites,"The coexistence of ferromagnetism and metallic conduction in doped manganites has long been explained by a double-exchange model in which the ferromagnetic exchange arises from the carrier hopping. We evaluate the zero-temperature spin stiffness D(0) and the Curie temperature T_{C} on the basis of the double-exchange model using the measured values of the bare bandwidth W and the Hund's rule coupling J_{H}. The calculated D(0) and T_{C} values are too small compared with the observed ones even in the absence of interactions. A realistic onsite interorbital Coulomb repulsion can reduce D(0) substantially in the case of a 2-orbital model. Furthermore, experiment shows that D(0) is simply proportional to x in La_{1-x}Sr_{x}MnO_{3} system, independent of whether the ground state is a ferromagnetic insulator or metal. These results strongly suggest that the ferromagnetism in manganites does not originate from the double-exchange interaction. On the other hand, an alternative model based on the d-p exchange can semi-quantitatively explain the ferromagnetism of doped manganites at low temperatures.",G. M.

The validity of this approximate theory has been tested by comparing its predictions with those from numerical self-consistent field calculations. Interactions among free carriers, accounted for using the local-spin-density approximation, substantially enhance the critical temperature.

The latter says that the Hochschild complex of an associative algebra carries a canonical structure of a dg-algebra over the chain operad of the little discs operad. In the course of the proof we construct an operad of geometric nature which acts on the Hochschild complex. It seems to be different from the brace operad (the latter was used in the previous approaches to the Deligne's conjecture). It follows from our results that the Grothendieck-Teichm\""uller group acts (homotopically) on the moduli space of structures of 2-algebras on the Hochschild complex.

To first order the `standard' model describes the afterglow observations well, but a wealth of information can be gathered from the deviations of GRB afterglow observations from this `standard' model. These deviations provide information on the nature of the progenitor and on the physics of GRB production.

astro-ph/0001464v1,"The Role of Electron Captures in Chandrasekhar Mass Models for Type Ia
  Supernovae","The Chandrasekhar mass model for Type Ia Supernovae (SNe Ia) has received increasing support from recent comparisons of observations with light curve predictions and modeling of synthetic spectra. It explains SN Ia events via thermonuclear explosions of accreting white dwarfs in binary stellar systems, being caused by central carbon ignition when the white dwarf approaches the Chandrasekhar mass. As the electron gas in white dwarfs is degenerate, characterized by high Fermi energies for the high density regions in the center, electron capture on intermediate mass and Fe-group nuclei plays an important role in explosive burning. Electron capture affects the central electron fraction Y_e, which determines the composition of the ejecta from such explosions. Up to the present, astrophysical tabulations based on shell model matrix elements were only available for light nuclei in the sd-shell. Recently new Shell Model Monte Carlo (SMMC) and large-scale shell model diagonalization calculations have also been performed for pf-shell nuclei. These lead in general to a reduction of electron capture rates in comparison with previous, more phenomenological, approaches. Making use of these new shell model based rates, we present the first results for the composition of Fe-group nuclei produced in the central regions of SNe Ia and possible changes in the constraints on model parameters like ignition densities and burning front speeds.",Franziska Brachwitz; David J.

By considering the evolutionary trend of log(Be/H) vs. both [Fe/H] and [O/H], we demonstrate that the CRI model is energetically untenable. We present evolutionary trends for B-11/B-10 and B/Be which, combined with future precision measurements, could distinguish between the CRS and CRI+LECR models. We show that delayed LiBeB synthesis in the CRS model, due to the transport of the cosmic rays, could explain why log(Be/H) is steeper vs. [O/H] than vs. [Fe/H]. We also show that delayed deposition of Fe into star forming regions, due to its incorporation into high velocity dust, could provide an explanation for the possible rise of [O/Fe] with decreasing [Fe/H].

We present computational simulations of current-voltage curves at finite temperatures for a single vortex in the array ($Ha^2/\Phi_0=f=1/L^2$), and experimental measurements in $100\times1000$ arrays under a low magnetic field corresponding to $f\approx0.02$. We find that the transverse voltage vanishes only in the directions of maximum symmetry of the square lattice: the [10] and [01] direction (parallel bias) and the [11] direction (diagonal bias). For orientations different than the symmetry directions, we find a finite transverse voltage which depends strongly on the angle $\phi$ of the current. We find that vortex motion is pinned in the [10] direction ($\phi=0$), meaning that the voltage response is insensitive to small changes in the orientation of the current near $\phi=0$. We call this phenomenon orientational pinning. This leads to a finite transverse critical current for a bias at $\phi=0$ and to a transverse voltage for a bias at $\phi\not=0$. On the other hand, for diagonal bias in the [11] direction the behavior is highly unstable against small variations of $\phi$, leading to a rapid change from zero transverse voltage to a large transverse voltage within a few degrees.

From the mean color index of the red giant branch, a mean metallicity [Fe/H]=-2.0 is obtained. The I magnitude of the TRGB has been used to estimate the distance. DDO 190 is 2.9+/-0.2 Mpc from the Milky Way, 2.1 Mpc from the M 94 group (CnV-I), 2.4 Mpc from the M 81 group and 2.9 Mpc from the barycenter of the Local Group, all indicating that it is an isolated, field galaxy. The surface-brightness distribution of the galaxy is well fitted by ellipses of ellipticity e=1-a/b=0.1 and P.A.=82deg. The radial star density distribution follows an exponential law of scale length a=43.""4, corresponding to 611 pc. The Holmberg semi-major axis to mu_B=26.5 is estimated to be r^B_(26.5)=3.'0. Stellar populations of different ages in DDO 190 show strong spatial decoupling, the oldest population appearing much more extended than the youngest. Stars younger than 0.1 Gyr occupy only the central 40'' (0.55 kpc); stars younger than a few (~4) Gyr extend out to ~80'' (125 kpc), and for larger galactocentric distances only older stars seem to be present.

This softening leads to more compact equilibrium configurations of neutron stars compared to pure hadronic stars of the same mass. We investigate the question to which amount the compactness of a neutron star can be attributed to the presence of a quark phase. For this purpose we employ several hadronic EOS in the framework of the relativistic mean-field (RMF) model and an extended MIT bag model to describe the quark phase. We find that - almost independent of the model parameters - the radius of a pure hadronic neutron star gets typically reduced by 20-30% if a pure quark phase in the center of the star does exist. For some EOS we furthermore find the possibility of a ""third family"" of compact stars which may exist besides the two known families of white dwarfs and neutron stars. We show how an experimental proof of the existence of a third family by mass and radius measurements may provide a unique signature for a phase transition inside neutron stars.",K. Schertler; C.

  with NGST","We derive the expected Type II SN differential number counts, N(m), and Hubble diagram for SCDM and LCDM cosmological models, taking into account the effects of gravitational lensing (GL) produced by the intervening cosmological mass. The mass distribution of dark matter halos (ie the lenses) is obtained by means of a Monte Carlo method applied to the Press-Schechter mass function. The halos are assumed to have a NFW density profile, in agreement with recent simulations of hierarchical cosmological models. Up to z=15, the (SCDM, LCDM) models predict a total number of (857, 3656) SNII/yr in 100 surveyed 4' times 4' fields of the Next Generation Space Telescope. NGST will be able to reach the peak of the N(m) curve, located at AB approx 30(31) for SCDM(LCDM) in J and K wavelength bands and detect (75%, 51%) of the above SN events. This will allow a detailed study of the early cosmic star formation history, as traced by SNIIe. N(m) is only very mildly affected by the inclusion of lensing effects. In addition, GL introduces a moderate uncertainty in the determination of cosmological parameters from Hubble diagrams, when these are pushed to higher $z$. For example, for a ``true'' LCDM with (Omega_M= 0.4, Omega_Lambda=0.6), without proper account of GL, one would instead derive (Omega_{M}=0.36^{+0.15}_{-0.12}, Omega_{Lambda}=0.60^{+0.12}_{-0.24}).

I employ two major assumptions: 1) that the absolute magnitude - metallicity, M_V(RR) - [Fe/H], relation for RR Lyrae stars is universal, and 2) that absolute I-magnitudes of clump giants, M_I(RC), in Baade's Window are known (e.g., can be inferred from the local Hipparcos-based calibration or theoretical modeling). A comparison between the solar neighborhood and Baade's Window sets M_V(RR) at [Fe/H] = -1.6 in the range (0.59 +/- 0.05, 0.70 +/- 0.05), somewhat brighter than the statistical parallax solution. More luminous RR Lyrae stars imply younger ages of globular cluster, which would be in better agreement with the conclusions from the currently favored stellar evolution and cosmological models. A comparison between Baade's Window and the LMC sets the M_I^{LMC}(RC) in the range (-0.33 +/- 0.09, -0.53 +/- 0.09). The distance modulus to the LMC, mu^{LMC}, is between 18.24 +/- 0.08 and 18.44 +/- 0.07. Unlike M_I^{LMC}(RC), this range in mu^{LMC} does NOT depend on the adopted value of the dereddened LMC clump magnitude, I_0^{LMC}(RC).

gr-qc/0001086v1,How much energy do closed timelike curves in 2+1 spacetimes need?,"By noticing that, in open 2+1 gravity, polarized surfaces cannot converge in the presence of timelike total energy momentum (except for a rotation of 2 pi), we give a simple argument which shows that, quite generally, closed timelike curves cannot exist in the presence of such energy condition.",Manuel H.

gr-qc/0001087v1,"Exotic spacetimes, superconducting strings with linear momentum, and
  (not quite) all that","We derive the general exact vacuum metrics associated with a stationary (non static), non rotating, cylindrically symmetric source. An analysis of the geometry described by these vacuum metrics shows that they contain a subfamily of metrics that, although admitting a consistent time orientation, display ""exotic"" properties, such as ""trapping"" of geodesics and closed causal curves through every point. The possibility that such spacetimes could be generated by a superconducting string, endowed with a neutral current and momentum, has recently been considered by Thatcher and Morgan. Our results, however, differ from those found by Thatcher and Morgan, and the discrepancy is explained. We also analyze the general possibility of constructing physical sources for the exotic metrics, and find that, under certain restrictions, they must always violate the dominant energy condition (DEC). We illustrate our results by explicitly analyzing the case of concentric shells, where we find that in all cases the external vacuum metric is non exotic if the matter in the shells satisfies the DEC.",Reinaldo J.

cond-mat/0001395v2,"Numerical Study on Aging Dynamics in Ising Spin-Glass Models:
  Temperature-Change Protocols","By means of Monte Carlo simulations on the three-dimensional Ising spin-glass model, we have studied aging phenomena with various temperature($T$)-change protocols. Particularly, a $T$-shift protocol, in which a system is first quenched to and aged for a period $t_{\rm w1}$ at a temperature $T_1$, and subsequently aged at a new temperature $T_2$ is closely investigated. Most importantly, the mean size of domains, which is extracted from the replica-overlap function, was found to grow monotonically without any appreciable decrease by the $T$-change. We also found the relaxation of energy density and spin auto-correlation function during the $T$-shift process can be explained within the following picture: the dynamics finally crossovers to an isothermal aging of $T_2$ at around $t_2 \simeq t_{\rm w1}^{\rm (eff)}$ after the $T$-change, where $t_{\rm w1}^{\rm (eff)}$ is an effective waiting time related with $t_{\rm w1}$, but in the transient regime $t_2 \lt t_{\rm w1}^{\rm (eff)}$, adjustment of the population of thermally active droplets from that at $T_1$ to $T_2$ takes place very slowly. Implications of the results on aging phenomena in other $T$-change protocols such as $T$-cycling and continuous $T$-change with an intermittent stop observed by simulations as well as experiments are discussed.",Tatsuo Komori; Hajime Yoshino; Hajime Takayama,cond-mat.dis-nn,cond-mat.dis-nn; cond-mat.stat-mech

gr-qc/0001088v1,A Symplectic Hamiltonian Derivation of Quasilocal Energy-Momentum for GR,"The various roles of boundary terms in the gravitational Lagrangian and Hamiltonian are explored. A symplectic Hamiltonian-boundary-term approach is ideally suited for a large class of quasilocal energy-momentum expressions for general relativity. This approach provides a physical interpretation for many of the well-known gravitational energy-momentum expressions including all of the pseudotensors, associating each with unique boundary conditions. From this perspective we find that the pseudotensors of Einstein and M{\o}ller (which is closely related to Komar's superpotential) are especially natural, but the latter has certain shortcomings. Among the infinite possibilities, we found that there are really only two Hamiltonian-boundary-term quasilocal expressions which correspond to {\em covariant} boundary conditions; they are respectively of the Dirichlet or Neumann type. Our Dirichlet expression coincides with the expression recently obtained by Katz and coworkers using Noether arguments and a fixed background. A modification of their argument yields our Neumann expression.",Chiang-Mei Chen; James M. Nester,gr-qc,gr-qc

  gases","Low-temperature magneto-photoluminescence studies of negatively charged excitons (X- trions) are reported for n-type modulation-doped ZnSe/Zn(Cd,Mn)Se quantum wells over a wide range of Fermi energy and spin-splitting. The magnetic composition is chosen such that these magnetic two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) are highly spin-polarized even at low magnetic fields, throughout the entire range of electron densities studied (5e10 to 6.5e11 cm^-2). This spin polarization has a pronounced effect on the formation and energy of X-, with the striking result that the trion ionization energy (the energy separating X- from the neutral exciton) follows the temperature- and magnetic field-tunable Fermi energy. The large Zeeman energy destabilizes X- at the nu=1 quantum limit, beyond which a new PL peak appears and persists to 60 Tesla, suggesting the formation of spin-triplet charged excitons.",S. A.

In this paper, we obtain a low-energy effective action and show that there exist quasi-Nambu-Goldsone bosons which are identified as the pions. The pion field is a {\em nonlocal} composite field of quark and anti-quark even at the strong-coupling limit because of the nonlocality of the overlap fermion formalism and L\""usher's chiral symmetry.

astro-ph/0001474v1,LiBeB Production and Associated Astrophysical Sites,"The various modes of spallative LiBeB production are summarized, and classified according to their dependence or independence on the abundance of medium heavy elements (CNO) illustrated by that of oxygen in the interstellar medium.   The predictions of the models are confronted to the available observational correlations (Be, B vs O). Clearly, a primary mechanism should lead to a slope one in the lg(Be/H) vs [O/H] plot and a secondary mechanism to a slope two. Due to the ambiguity of the O data, another criterion, based on energetics, can help us to select an adequate model. A purely secondary origin in the very early Galaxy is much more energy demanding than a primary one. Indeed, magnesium seems to be a possible surrogate of oxygen and iron since i) it is spectroscopically more easy to cope with and ii) its nucleosynthetic yield is independent of the mass cut and does not depend on metallicity.",Elisabeth Vangioni-Flam; Michel Casse,astro-ph,astro-ph
astro-ph/0001475v1,"Investigations of the Local Supercluster Velocity Field III. Tracing the
  backside infall with distance moduli from the direct Tully-Fisher relation","We have extended the discussion of Paper II (Ekholm et al. 1999) to cover also the backside of the Local Supercluster (LSC) by using 96 galaxies within Theta<30 deg from the adopted centre of LSC and with distance moduli from the direct B-band Tully-Fisher relation. In order to minimize the influence of the Malmquist bias we required log V_max>2.1 and sigma_{B_T}<0.2 mag.   We found out that if R_Virgo<20 Mpc this sample fails to follow the expected dynamical pattern from the Tolman-Bondi (TB) model. When we compared our results with the Virgo core galaxies given by Federspiel et al. (1998) we were able to constrain the distance to Virgo: R_Virgo=20-24 Mpc.   When analyzing the TB-behaviour of the sample as seen from the origin of the metric as well as that with distances from the extragalactic Cepheid PL-relation we found additional support to the estimate R_Virgo=21 Mpc given in Paper II. Using a two-component mass-model we found a Virgo mass estimate M_Virgo= (1.5-2)M_virial, where M_virial=9.375.10^14M_sun for R_Virgo=21 Mpc. This estimate agrees with the conclusion in Paper I (Teerikorpi et al. 1992).   Our results indicate that the density distribution of luminous matter is shallower than that of the total gravitating matter when q_0<=0.5. The preferred exponent in the density power law, alpha\approx2.5, agrees with recent theoretical work on the universal density profile of dark matter clustering in an Einstein-deSitter universe (Tittley & Couchman 1999).",T.

hep-th/0001179v1,Absorption Cross Section of Scalar Field in Supergravity Background,"It has recently been shown that the equation of motion of a massless scalar field in the background of some specific p branes can be reduced to a modified Mathieu equation. In the following the absorption rate of the scalar by a D3 brane in ten dimensions is calculated in terms of modified Mathieu functions of the first kind, using standard Mathieu coefficients. The relation of the latter to Dougall coefficients (used by others) is investigated. The S-matrix obtained in terms of modified Mathieu functions of the first kind is easily evaluated if known rapidly convergent low energy expansions of these in terms of products of Bessel functions are used. Leading order terms, including the interesting logarithmic contributions, can be obtained analytically.",R. Manvelyan; H. J. W. Mueller-Kirsten; J. -Q. Liang; Yunbo Zhang,hep-th,hep-th
astro-ph/0001476v2,Young Stellar Populations Around SN1987A,"We present the results of a study of the stellar population in a region of 30 pc radius around SN1987A, based on an analysis of multi-band HST-WFPC2 images.   The effective temperature, radius and, possibly, reddening of each star were determined for 21,955 stars by fitting the measured broad band magnitudes to the ones calculated with model atmospheres. In addition, we have identified all stars with Halpha equivalent widths in excess of 8 A, amounting to a total of 492 stars.   An inspection to the HR diagram reveals the presence of several generations of young stars, with ages between 1 and 150 Myrs, superposed on a much older field population (0.6-6 Gyrs). A substantial fraction of young stars have ages around 12 Myrs which is the stellar generation coeval to SN 1987A progenitor. The youngest stars in the field appear to be strong-line T Tauri stars. This constitute the first positive detection of low mass (about 1-2 Mo) Pre Main Sequence (PMS) stars outside the Milky Way. Their positions in the HR diagram appear to require that star formation in the LMC occurs with accretion rates about 10 times higher than in the Milky Way, i.e. ~10^{-4} Mo/yr.   SN1987A appears to belong to a loose, young cluster 12+/-2 Myrs old, in which the slope of the present mass function is almost identical to Salpeter's for masses above 3 Mo, but becomes much flatter for lower masses. On a large scale, we find that the spatial distribution of massive stars and low-mass PMS stars are conclusively different. This results casts doubts on the validity of an IMF concept on a small scale (say, less than 10 pc). A preliminary analysis, done for the whole field as a single entity, shows that the IMF slope for the young population present over the entire region is steeper than Gamma ~ -1.7.",Nino Panagia; Martino Romaniello; Salvatore Scuderi; Robert P.
